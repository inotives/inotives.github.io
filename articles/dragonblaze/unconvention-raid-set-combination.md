#### Unconvention Raid Set Combination

---


Equipment is one of the important factor in dragon blaze. It is also one the the most pain in the ass things to change when there is new set of raid equipment.
On this article, i am not gonna discuss on what effect each set gives ([HERE](/game/dragon-blaze/item) if you wanna check out the set effect), but i shall list out some unconvention mixing of raid set. What is mixing of raid set? basically you are not using full of a raid set but use 2 or 4 of each raid set for the bonus they gave.

  NOTES: I will update this article from time to time when there are new set being introduce. If you have some interesting set combi, you could let me know on the comment below.

##### HP Boost Combi

<div class="row">
  <div class="col l4 m5 s12">
    Combination:
      <ul>
        <li>4 x Legend Raid Set (S3)</li>
        <li>2 x Destructive Ragnarok Set</li>
      </ul>
    Combi Effect:
      <ul>
        <li>HP +34991, Weap.ATK +1166</li>
        <li>Weap.ATK +1362, Acc +93</li>
        <li>HP +51678, C.DMG +173.3</li>
      </ul>

    PROS: <br/>
    This is a tanky build that is for tanker unit. With 2 HP bonus from both set, your HP will increase alot +86669. More over, it take 2 ATK bonus from 2 set so your overall ATK will increase by 2528. It is an alternative choice for Kymeal, Geala, Howl which do not really need Atk.Spd. Best to use 2 Legend weapon coz they will carry higher base ATK.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    CONS: <br/>
    Major downside of this set will be the DefPen and Atk.Spd. By omitted the set bonus, you ATK.SPD will hurt alot. Those unit that rely on their atk.spd to proc CDR would suffer if use this combination. Some way to fix this is use full set Arena Accesorry to fill up the atk.spd and def pen loses.

##### Speedster Combi

<div class="row">
  <div class="col l4 m5 s12">
    Combination:
      <ul>
        <li>4 x Ragnarok Set(76)</li>
        <li>2 x Deus Ragnarok U(80)</li>
      </ul>
    Combi Effect:
      <ul>
        <li>HP +7884, Weap.ATK +551</li>
        <li>DEF +771, ATK.SPD +31</li>
        <li>HP +8510, ATK.SPD +34</li>
      </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="col l8 m7 s12">
    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    PROS: <br/>
    This combination is aim for speeds. With both set bonus spd, total speed get from this set will be +65. This set is good for Buffer class that equip with 2xCDR. More atk speed will allow buffer to proc CDR more often. Try to use 4x armor set of ragnarok and 2x weapon from deus ragna U. This set is still used by some in WB for their buffer class like Ravengale, Belle or even Falcon (to proc more invul barrier).
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    CONS: <br/>
    Main downfall of this combi would be the DMG Output. Without the Double Crits (C.RATE & C.DMG) there are almost no DMG at all from this combination. that why this combination is aim for buffer which do not really need dmg. and also this set is using raid set that is few patch back, the total HP that it gave would not be much. but due to 2 HP bonus from this set, it is kinda sustainable to certain extend if you are lucky to get high stats on them.

##### Speedster Combi - 2

<div class="row">
  <div class="col l4 m5 s12">
    Combination:
      <ul>
        <li>4 x Myth Set (S3)</li>
        <li>2 x Deus Ragnarok U(80)</li>
      </ul>
    Combi Effect:
      <ul>
        <li>Weap.ATK +1627, Acc +98</li>
        <li>HP +66465, ATK.SPD +43</li>
        <li>HP +8510, ATK.SPD +34</li>
      </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="col l8 m7 s12">
    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    PROS: <br/>
    Major improvement on Speedster Combi with the introduce of Myth set. This allow overall atk.spd to increase by +77. Moreover the overall HP increase with the myth set bonus. Overall survival of buffer increase as well due to the myth set will carry large boost on base stats over Ragna set in speedster 1. Use this with double CDR to proc more. Main usage is for the buffer ally (possible to be used on mag priest as well).
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    CONS: <br/>
    Main downfall for this combi is still the same as speedster 1, there are no C.DMG as well as DefPen. So this set is not really for DPS used. mainly for Buffer usage.

      </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="col l8 m7 s12">
    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    PROS: <br/>
    This was one of the most popular set combi back in the when deus ragna just introduced. The main advantages of this combination is the overall C.DMG Bonus. with both set, total C.DMG Set Bonus will be +253.5. With double HP bonus, it make your ally tankier as well.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    CONS: <br/>
    This is old set combination. The major downside of this set will be the overall base stats and HP bonuses compare to the new season 4 raid set (Frozen Tyrant onward). Moreover the defpen bonus is omitted, so you will need to get some def pen from your weapons else your dmg will suffer.

    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    PROS: <br/>
    With 4 set of frozen tyrant, you C.DMG will be higher than previous CDMG Combi +264.3. This combination have lesser HP but gain more DMG output through the bonus of DefPen.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    CONS: <br/>
    Major downside of the combination would be atk.spd. You could use arena accesorry to fill the losses. Moreover they are using previous raid set, so it will lose out interm of base stats as compare to more recent raid.

    Improvement over the previous CDMG Combi with the latest legend raid set. Overall C.DMG output would be +296.2. Along with 2xHP bonus from both set. Total HP bonus set +59687. Try to use the Legend Set Weapons as it carry waaaay more Base ATK than Darkness set Weapons.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    CONS: <br/>
    The same downside for CDMG Combi as the previous 2, ATK.SPD. Moreover, this set also omitted the DefPen. So you will need to use Arena Accesorry to fill up the loses.
