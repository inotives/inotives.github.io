#### Transcended Draco Summary

---

As Transcended Wave is round the corner on DB-Global, many players are confuse or lost in their focus on the game. This article is to shine some light to the players out there. Please do note that this is based on my own opinion, you could agree and disagree from what i think. There are many ways ppl will suggest. Mine was one the few.

I shall break down each Transcended dracos with their strong points, area of expertise and whether or not to max/ult them. OK let start shall we?


##### Pros & Cons of Each Trans Draco
---

I shall rank them in term of their usefulness, pros & cons, performing area and how long they gonna remain in meta.

> - RANK-1 - T.Deathcrown
> - RANK-2 - T.Blackaria
> - RANK-3 - T.Bloodwind
> - RANK-4 - T.Greysoul
> - RANK-5 - T.Brightspark

Here are more details.

###### RANK-1: T.Deathcrown
---

I rank TDC as the most useful trans in t.draco wave, because his skill set can be use in almost all contents of the game.

*PROS:*
> - Good buff skills(810% DMG, 55% ATK.SPD & Full Immunity) to be use in WB and GA
> - Good de-buff skills (DEF -100%, Stuns, Remove Buffs, ATK -45% ) to be use in PVP area (Arena, Tag Match)
> - Superb Tanker (alot of self DMG reduce skills) + Buffer in Tag Match with immunity to Instakill (to counter TGS) as well as Reflect DMG back to opponent.

*CONS:*
> - Although he have decent DMG, but he is not really a DPS. You still need a DPS in order to score well especially in WB and GA.


*Performing Area:*
> - Tag Match - Tanker/Buffers
> - WB & GA - Buffer
> - Arena - Tanker/Buffers

*MAX Needed?*
> If you are making him as buffer for WB, not really need to be maxed, but if you are using him in Tag Match better to Max him.

*Meta Duration*
> TDC is replaceable after T.Stormbear is out. So we could utilize him for a long time. Even when T.Stormbear is out, he is only slightly more powerful than > TDC in the tanking area. While pt buff, i still prefer TDC.

*Conclusion*
> If you are just gonna make 1 Trans, i dont suggest to make TDC, you wont see much ranking improvement.
> If you are making 2 trans or more, TDC could be one of the them along with 1 DPS unit.

###### RANK-2: T.Blackaria
---

She is the only healer unit in trans draco. Not only a healer, she is equip with good buffing skills that helps in crunching DMG for the pt in WB and GA.

*PROS:*
> - All rounder in all area of the game with her heals, buffs, cleanse and revive.
> - She also have very high survival with debuff duration shorten and self revive.
> - Upon death, she will cast invulnerability to whole pt for 8 sec.

*CONS:*
> - Her active buffs is removable.
> - Not ideal as 1st Transcended to make.

*Performing Area*
> All Area of the game

*MAX Needed?*
> Ideally her Max skill make her very hard to kill and very good in Arena. But if you are resources crunch, she could be leave it with +0 and slowly upgrade as you proceed.


*Meta Duration*
> As far as i know, her utility in Arena is very very long and only replaceable once T.Merc is out. So she could be quite for quite some times as well. As buffer, T.Farrah probably would replace her in golem coz her buff is removeable by golem. T.Manalandy also a good replacement for her as buffer.


*Conclusion*
> She is definitely a `must` make ally for long run. But not an ideal transcended to make if you are just making 1 at the start of the trans patch.

###### RANK-3: T.Bloodwind
---

*PROS:*
> - Superb Normal Atk with def reduction per atk as well as buffs to increase his DMG per atks or per atk avoided.
> - AoE DPS and one of the most DMG Dealer for WB and GA with DoT DMG Skill as well.

*CONS:*

> - Lack in survival in PVP contents due to lower defensive stats.

*Performing Area*
> - What else? World Bosses and Guild Adventure as `DPS`

*MAX Needed?*
> Definitely need him to be `MAX` on start in order to get the optimum performance.

*Meta Duration*
> For Golem and Hydra, T.lly would be out-DMG him. But we might be seeing both in use when the time comes. At least we would be seeing his usage in WB until Trans boden wave. For Shari, he was good in Def Reduce the boss, but until some more trans healer/buffer is out, he will be replaced. On new WB - Cerberus, he was one of the meta due to the world boss mekanism that it is better to use all DPS unit.

*Conclusion*
> TBW is one of the best DPS and a `must` if you want to score well in WB and GA. If you are making just 1 Trans Draco, i would suggest to make him to improve your scoring tremendously.

###### RANK-4: T.Greysoul
---

*PROS:*
> - Good PVP skill with Instant Death debuffs on all his skills.
> - On PVE, his skill set deal big number to WB-Golem

*CONS:*
> - Huge skill cooldown.
> - Low survival coz no self restoration and self-defensive buffs.
> - His death debuffs can be removed, so unit with cleanse is his arch enemy.

*Performing Area*
> - WB: Golem & Cerberus
> - Arena
> - Tag Match

*MAX Needed?*
> He is a DPS, you need him to be Max in order to deal more DMG.

*Meta Duration*
> He is not really meta much in WB, he is decent in golem and good in Cerberus. Hydra he was lacking. As per usual with DPS unit, they are quite often been replace with newest unit when they are released (especially in arena).

*Conclusion*
> He is decent in all area and quite easy to make with stigma as a decent key as well in Dealing DMG. But he is not really the best out there. But for starter, he is quite good for new player to start with but not really useful in long run. so if you make him, you should think of his replacement in future in order to maintain your ranks.

###### RANK-5: T.Brightspark  
---

*PROS:*
> - PVP-Oriented Skill set with 3 AoE Skills that debuffs, stuns and steal buffs.
> - Once she enter her God Mode (3rd Active), basically is Good Game for you.

*CONS:*
> - Totally not much can be done in WB and GA, not her area of expertise.
> - As per usual with DPS unit in Arena, her role is easily replaceable and counter with better unit release in future.

*Performing Area*
> - Arena
> - Tag Match

*MAX Needed?*
> without `Max` she is quite easy to kill. so Max is recommended.

*Meta Duration*
> After T.Geala is release, she was replaceable. When T.Farrah is out, her one-hit-KO is countered. So she have relatively short meta period.

*Conclusion*
> Although she have tremendous ability in PVP area, but with the limitation and short meta period, she should be avoided if you have choice.

##### Most Cost Effective Team
---

What i mean by cost effective is the amount of the cost you spent (Rubies, essences, allies) while getting higher ranks.
When the transcended patch hit, i speculate that most of the players on global will be with 1 to 3 transcended. Minimumly you will need to have *1 DPS* and *1 Support Buffer* in order to score decent in all contents (Around 10%). As per usual, DPS need to be `MAX` in order to have their full potential. Support/Buffer unit could hold them and upgrade later on. Here are some suggestion:

1. If you are only making 1 Transcended:
> - Choose a DPS unit. Best one should be [Transcended Bloodwind](/game/dragon-blaze/transcended/transcended-draco-bloodwind).
> - Try to aim for MAX the DPS unit

2. If you are able to make 2 or more trans:
> even you are able to make all, i would suggest to target at least 1 MAX dps with at least 1 Support. Here are some suggestion:
> - 1 MAX DPS + 1 Support/Buffer, COST: `460 T.Ess, 27 SSS allies and 205 Mil GOLD` :: *TBW + TBA/TDC*
> - 1 MAX DPS + 2 Support/Buffer, COST: `510 T.Ess, 27 SSS allies and 255 Mil GOLD`. :: *TBW + TBA + TDC*
