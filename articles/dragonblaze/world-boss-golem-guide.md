#### World Boss Guide: Lava Golem

---

Lava golem is one of the three world bosses in Dragon Blaze. This world boss is available on Tuesday. This is the first world boss introduce in Dragon blaze. The reward for golem is given base on the score you obtained by dealing dmg to the boss. The HP bar on top was replaced by timer count down for the boss. This boss will activates his Rage skill at certain interval which player need to break the rage or else it will go into rage-mode (frenzy) and deal massive DMG. Player are allowed to retry this world boss for *10 times*.  

`SIDE-NOTES`: For new player, Try to get pass 1 Million score, you will get *15 Rubies* additional as reward and do it 10x every week, that would be 300k easy GOLD income.

##### 1. PARTY COMPOSITION

For this world boss, `single burst DMG DPS` is preferred. Those DPS allies / deity / key that have high single target active skill will be able to perform well in this world boss. Other than DPS we will also need buffer in the team to increase dmg out through party buffs. Here are list of allies and keys that are goods in the current WB-Golem.


| ALLY & KEY           | ROLE | PERFORMANCE | DETAILS |
| :------------------- | :--- | :---------- | :------ |
| [Ravengale](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/ravengale-the-kind) | BUFFER | SSS | Ravengale is one of the few buffer in the game. It buffs whole pt with atk.spd up and atk up. This is crucial in maximizing the score for this WB. |
| [Iota](/game/dragon-blaze/key/iota) in [Margaret](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/Margaret)  | BUFFER | SSS | Iota is best buffer key in-game for world boss. it has passive dmg increase for whole pt when fighting agaisnt world boss as well as buffs that increase pt atk and atk.spd. Using margaret as keyholder so that we could use iota side by side with [Ravengale](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/ravengale-the-kind). |
| Priest (Magnify Build) | BUFFER | SSS | Probably the only MC that can score high in Golem due to her mass pt buff (ATK & ATK.SPD). alternatively, you could also use Paladin (3rd Active Build) but less effective than mag-priest. *NOTE: if you have Epsilon, equip it on priest and set it to 1% summon. This will help you last longer in late golem fight.* |
| [Omega](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dragon-buster-omega) in [D.Falcon](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/drunken-falcon) | BUFFER | SSS | Omega + Falcon is another scoring factor in World Boss. Falcon has passive to increase normal atk by 100% and omega also have passive that increase normal atk by 100%, and you know what, both are applicable if you use falcon with omega key, your pt normal atk will increase by 200%. |
| [Stigma](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dragon-buster-stigma) in [Lucienne](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/dragon-slayer-lucienne) / Loki / Fulson / Mikaela | DPS | SSS | Stigma is one of the best DPS unit for this WB mainly due to his 3rd active self buff that allow him to deal critical on every normal atk. He is able to break golem def with his first skill. Best keyholder would be Lucienne but altenatively you could use loki / fulson / mikaela. |
| [Tiehr](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-tiehr) in Lucienne / Loki / Fulson / Mikaela | DPS | SSS | I preferred to use Lucienne with Stigma, but some Tops player use Tiehr with lucienne. You could try and see whether this works for you. I used Tiehr with Mikaela. I will try it about in more runs next week with tiehr in lucienne. |
| Belle | Helper | SS | She is the only SSS Ally that is still useable in WB as buffer helper. She could buff ATK to whole pt which make her OK to use (as Helper or alternative buffer). Try to build her tanky, STA gems and defensive stats is preferred. |
| [Llywelyn](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/llywelyn-the-fiery) | DPS | SS | She was the best DPS unit for WB before key is introduce. Now she is kinda deprecated, but still OK to use. The recent balancing equip her with life-steal, make her survive longer. She is not really good as keyholder coz none of her passive get carry over. |
| [Trigger](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/arrow-trigger-the-iron-bullet) with [Ouranos](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dragon-buster-ouranos) | DPS | SS | She is doing OK by herself in Golem due to her passive that increase pt CDMG by 42. But if you have ouranos, use it on her coz that passive also get carried over after key transform. |

##### 2. FORMATION

Formation playing subtantial role in increasing your dmg out put. Here are some popular formation use in this world boss.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <h6 class="amber-text text-ligthen-3">Fire Support <small>(Current Fav)</small></h6>
    <u>POINT ALLOCATION:</u> Max Both DPS Position on the side. Now it is arguable part. Some ppl Max Normal slot at the rear (coz it is buffer slot) for increase ATk.SPD and other they max the Normal Slot at the mid. I think each had their advantage. If for WB purpose, maxing rear normal slot is not that bad, your buffer cast faster = more CDR = more buff. If you max the Mid Normal slot is more advantage if you are using this formation for other content like Arena. The choice is up to you.
    <br/><br/>
    This formation is just introduce in DB-Global recently and it is gaining popularity coz of the flexibility it has. 3 Slot that increase Base DMG and 1 rear slot that increase Atk.Spd is damn good. Use this formation with 2 Rogues-key and the rest are buffer.

    <br/><br/>
    <u>TEAM SUGGESTION:</u> <br/>
    ~ MAIN: Mag-Priest, Margaret+Iota, Lucienne+(Stigma/Tiehr), (Mikaela/Fulson/Loki/Lucienne)+Tiehr, Falcon+Omega. HELPER: Ravengale <br/>
    ~ MAIN: Mag-Priest, Margaret+Iota, Lucienne+(Stigma/Tiehr), Ravengale, Falcon+Omega. HELPER: Belle Snow<br/>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <h6 class="amber-text text-ligthen-3">Incredible Concentration </h6>
    <u>POINT ALLOCATION:</u> Max DPS and both MAGE position in the middle. spend the rest of point in the Normal post at the rear.
    <br/><br/>
    One of most popular formation in offensive build. if u just use it for WB, you could try to Max rear normal position by substract some point from both Mage position. Usually those are for Buffer (raven & iota) in WB.

    <br/><br/>
    <u>TEAM SUGGESTION:</u> <br/>
    ~ MAIN: Mag-Priest, Ravengale, Margaret+Iota, Lucienne+Stigma, Falcon+Omega. HELPER: Belle Snow <br/>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <h6 class="amber-text text-ligthen-3">Merciless Breakthrough </h6>
    <u>POINT ALLOCATION:</u> Max Both Rogue position, spread point balance for both Normal position at the rear.
    <br/><br/>
    This formation used 2 Rogue-key (Stigma & Tiehr) to deal massive DMG to golem while putting buffer team at the rear with ATK.SPD boost (position advantage). Life steal from formation is also another added advantage for survival (but not that much after late Golem when he is very much raging...)

    <br/><br/>
    <u>TEAM SUGGESTION:</u> <br/>
    ~ MAIN: Mag-Priest, Margaret+Iota, Lucienne+Stigma, (Mikaela/Fulson/Loki)+Tiehr, Falcon+Omega. HELPER: Ravengale <br/>
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>


##### 3. WEAPON EFFECTS

Another important factor in WB if you gonna score high. Below are some Weapon effect you need for this world boss:

- *STIGMA: 1 DEF Down & 1 CDR*. Golem is just a single target. With more defense decrease, it will lead to higher DMG = Higher Scoring. 1 CDR is needed for stigma in order to shorten the CD for his self-buff actives.
- *IOTA, Mag-Priest, Ravengale, Belle: 2xCDR*. With 2xCDR buffer, CD for pt buffs become shorter and even possible to stacks multiple buffs together. More buffs = More scores...
- *Tiehr: 2xCDR / 1CDR, 1Def-Down*. This is arguable. Tiehr Normal atk was not that high as compare to Stigma, So Def Down might not help as much. but Her skills deal more DMG than her Normal Atk. therefore with 2xCDR, she could use more skills = more DMG dealt.


##### 4. CARDS

On World boss, Your DPS should have at least BOSS.DMG Card equip. This card increase your DMG to world boss tremendously. But Thanks to that, the ally that use this BOSS Card will be less useful in PVP Content (such as Arena).
The best card available for this boss should be *DEX+Boss.DMG*. If u are lucky to get it, besure to use it first on Lucienne (if u have).

For Buffer, most of the time it will be ATK.SPD card. Dual card should be Sta+ATK.SPD card or their BaseStats(DEX,STR,INT)+ATK.SPD Card.




##### 5. Finalizing & Test Run

Lets test try what i mentioned above. Here is my ally equipment and setup:

- Mag-Priest: 2xCDR (i don have epsilon ... )
- Lucienne (Stigma+MAX): 1 CDR x 1 DEF.DOWN, CARD: DEX+BOSS.DMG
- Mikaela (Tiehr+MAX): 1 CDR x 1 DEF.DOWN, CARD: BOSS.DMG
- Ravengale: 2xCDR, CARD: ATK.SPD Up
- Margaret (Iota+0): 2xCDR, CARD: ATK.SPD Up
- Falcon (Omega+MAX): 2xCDR, CARD: ATK.SPD Up

Below was the test run result.

- 1st Run with Fire Support Formation, MAIN: Mag-Priest, Lucienne+Stigma, Mikaela+Tiehr, Margaret+Iota, Falcon+Omega. HELPER: Ravengale.
![Golem Run 1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/world-boss-golem-guide-001.jpg)

- 2nd Run with Fire Support Formation, MAIN: Mag-Priest, Lucienne+Stigma, Ravengale, Margaret+Iota, Falcon+Omega. HELPER: Belle Snow.
![Golem Run 1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/world-boss-golem-guide-002.jpg)

- 3rd Run with Incredible Concentration Formation, MAIN: Mag-Priest, Lucienne+Stigma, Ravengale, Margaret+Iota, Falcon+Omega. HELPER: Belle Snow.
![Golem Run 1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/world-boss-golem-guide-003.jpg)

- 4th Run with Merciless Breakthrough, MAIN: Mag-Priest, Lucienne+Stigma, Mikaela+Tiehr, Margaret+Iota, Falcon+Omega. HELPER: Ravengale.
![Golem Run 1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/world-boss-golem-guide-004.jpg)


So from the test run, you could see that for the current meta, you will need 2 Rogues key in order to be in 1% ranker. Beyond 1% you will need to have epsilon which prolong the fights after Priest HP hit 1%.
