        <p>
          The current meta formation in term of overall DMG output. It has 3 position that give Base.DMG buff (52%) and Fixed DMG (28.1% -- purple color dmg), It is use widely in every content especially on World-Boss. It have 2 Normal position which is also flexible. This formation is totally worth the rubies, you could consider to get it. Usually the most troublesome for this formation is the positioning of your priest to the rear position, When your priest HP is too much, the position will place your priest to Mid Normal position. Try to shift your priest equipment to lesser HP or try to Increase your DPS/Buffer HP if you wan them at the mid-normal position.

        </p>
        <p>
          This is a very archer-centric formation that increase the crit.rate and crit.damage that help in bursting dmg. It was one of the WB-Meta formation in the old days. but with archers being replaced by rogues in WB, this formation also goes to retirement.

        </p>
        <p>
          This formation is actually pretty similar to Fire Support. But it require specific class (Mage) on the mid-position which make it less flexible as compare to fire support. But the dmg buff from this formation does not lose to Fire Support (52% on Front and 3 Mid position). It is used quite widely in WB before Fire Support is out in Global DB.

          Not really sure, i don use this formation. But here is my suggestion. Max 3 Normal Position (most prob DPS will come here) and remaining to Warrior position.
        </p>
        <p>
          This formation have very low restriction on ally placement but also not much offensive in the position. Not many player use this formation. Not really worth investing.

        </p>
        <p>
          This is a formation where healer might not be needed. The life steal from the formation could maintain the survival of the team. It is strong in offensive as well with C.DMG boost on rogues positions. The rear normal position can be for Buffer or Healers. Quite often see this formation in arena as well as WB before Fire Support is out.

        <p>
          A balanced formation that required all class to be in. Increase their base stats in their class corresponding position. This formation is not popular coz of its strict class requirement. Not really worth the rubies to invest in.

          This Formation have a good balanced in term of offensive and healing. It has 2 DPS position that boost DMG and 2 healer position that heal the pt and 1 tanker to be a meat shield. This formation also provide DMG reflect which make it good to use in Arena.

        <p>
          This is one of the 2 formation that is given for free. This formation is quite popular in arena, laby and dungeon mainly due to its general effect that decrease incoming DMG by 12% when max (and of course it is FREE). 2 Tanker at the front could protect the rear healer from ATK.

          You can choose to Max out either rear normal-position for survival or max-out the front warrior-position for more DMG. I would leave out the DPS position. Open to discussion on this.
        </p>
        <p>
          This formation is quite flexible with its low ally restriction. 2 Normal position at the rear could be DPS/Healer/Buffer. This formation is quite popular choice in arena due to its AoE DMG reduction.

          This is a very Priest-Tank Centric Formation. Not very flexible due to the need of 2 Priest and 2 Tank. Very weak offensive, but increase alot of HP due to STA boost hence greater survivality. Not many players use this formation. Not really worth the rubies to invest in this.

          Quite similar to Patient Chivalry but with only 1 War unit. But the formation effect does not seem very useful. never see much usage anywhere.
