<blockquote class="red-text text-lighten-4"> <strong>UPDATE</strong> :: Due to the Trans wave coming, it is better to follow the Guideline of preparing for Trans on your Beginner Mission ( [HERE](#4-preparing-for-trans) ).

##### CHARACTERS AND STARTING
---

As beginner, you will be given 3 Character Slots for you to make your character. Checkout this [Character Info](/game/dragon-blaze/char) for more information on each class and what they excel in. Here are my suggestion for which character to make and train in sequence. each new slots cost 99 rubies to unlock.

1. *Paladin* - Excel in almost all area in PVP and PVE
2. *Mage* - Good in PVP Mode (Guild Battle - Hero)
3. *Rogue* - Good in Raid Boss
4. *NEW Slot: Warrior* - Adequate in every mode in game
5. *NEW Slot: Priest* - Excel in Raid Bosses for Equipment
6. *NEW Slot: Archer* - Good in PVP Mode (Guild Battle - Hero)

After you made the first 3 characters, you can start your game with `PALADIN`.


##### DAY 1
---

Daily Login Reward: *Hero Summon Ticket*

<i>OVERVIEW: </i>

- Start with Paladin & progress through story + save up 1490 rubies.
- Once you have the rubies, follow the [Fast Rubies Earning with each Class](#fast-rubies-earning-with-each-class)
- Start your Beginner Mission - Get Greysoul as from mission-1 reward

<i>HERO TIX SUMMON SUGGESTION: </i> Get a *Tiel* for awaken to [Tiel the Justice](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/tiel-the-justice).

<i>TODAY TARGET: </i>

- Reach end of Season 2 area with Paladin
- Raid all the raid boss in Season 1 and Season 2 area for paladin
- Earn 1490 Rubies for Special Jar of Growth for Mage
- Raid all the bosses for Mage in Season 1 and 2 area


<i>DETAILS: </i>

So to start the day, i created these 3 characters on free slot (would create more later on).
![dragon blaze beginner guide - start](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-001.jpg)

Start your game with `Paladin`. You will be given 2xSSS ally as daily login reward. Summon them and add them to your team. Don't rush to enhance them first, you wont need them to progress season 1 AT ALL. Paladin is strong enough to clear the whole map of season 1. Unless you obtain some Rogue ally, you could start to enhance them if want because they will be needed later on to make Rogue Deity. For now, you just need to progress through story and level up. While doing those, you will be rewarded with various reward (Rubies, SS Allies, Gold).

You will notice there is a beginner mission pop-up, you open and start your first beginner mission. Choose any dragon buster (it doesnot matter). Next you will be completing 1st Mission and gotten the reward:
- 1 Draco Select Ticket - Get a [Draco Greysoul](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-greysoul)
- 4x Platinum Ally Package - these are 9+1 Platinum Summon at Shop > Summon Tab > Platinum Ally Package
- 30 Light Essences
- 4 Million Gold

Yes, for the Draco tix, get a Greysoul. Now you need to Ultimate him to complete the mission and get the reward for Mission-2. These probably will take some time and cant be done on first day i guess. so Check out these section: [Beginner Mission Explained](#beginner-mission-explained), for the rest of Beginner Mission.

During the story progression, you will be briefed about skills. For paladin, pump all points into Active 1 - Judgement and max 1st Passive - Def Up. These 2 skills are all u need to get through season 1 and 2 area. Add 1 or 2 point on 2nd Active and Max 3rd Active. Checkout full paladin build [HERE](/game/dragon-blaze/char/paladin). The one i used here are the Sword/Healer Paladin. Most probably in future, you might need to spent some rubies to reset your paladin build to other build like full keyholder build to better perform in other area. but for now, that build is the safest for you to kill all Raid Boss easily.

When you reach the raid boss dungeons, do raid them at least once each to obtain reward rubies. All Season 1 raid boss will give you around 539 Rubies.
Once you have 300 rubies, go to *Shop* > under *Item* tab > check the *Helper Set* > use *300 rubies* to buy the *Paladin Helper Set*. This set will help you clear almost all season 1 and season 2 area with ease and also can be shared with your warrior character later on.

Move on through the story with your paladin, most probably you could clear until season 2. Use some rubies to purchase shoes (no worry you will earn them back in no time). Some tips on earning Rubies:

- While progressing through stories, train your allies' rapport. Each ally that hit rapport 100, will reward you 10 Rubies.
- Raid all the Boss Dungeon once when you reach them.
- Check all the contents that is unlocked while level up. example arena can only be access when you are lvl 25. Enter and fight for 1st time will give you 100 rubies + weekly participation of 50 rubies. Do join once for all the contents that is unlocked for you.
- Join a Guild and Participate in Guild PVP and PVE contents. Those will net you some rubies as well.
- Check out GM Events and try to clear them, some of the even have rubies as rewards.

After i complete my paladin until season 2 end as well as complete all the raid from season 1 to 2 (except ragnarok, coz my level is too low. need at leas 76), here are what i got:
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-002.jpg)

I used some rubies to buy inventory slots (now i have 3 pages), shoes and a Helper Set (as mentioned previously). Now move on to earn more rubies =).

Now with those rubies, we could move on to a new character and earn MORE rubies. Go to character selection screen and start your `Mage` (or Priest). Now why Mage? This is because of the Equipment Links, you could link your ally or character equipment together, more detail on this on this article [HERE](https://dbkrblog.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/gear-linking-guide/), although it is in Korean, but you get the gist of it. Basically the reason i chose mage coz the special jar of growth will give you a helper set which could be Link to Priest character or allies that use Staff and Orb, which is why you could also choose `Priest` next instead of Mage, it is your choice. NEVER Choose a `Warrior` for your special jar of growth coz your warrior could get the Equipment Link from Paladin, which you will waste those gear from Special jar of growth.

Now, progress through your new character (mage in my case) story until you had unlocked the 4 slot of inventory. Next go to *Shop* > *Item* tab > purchase the `Special Jar of Growth - cost 1490 Rubies` which can only be purchased once per account. This will give you:

- Straight lvl ur character to lvl 99, Unlocked all the dungeons and quest till end of Season 3.
- 5xSSS Class Selection ally Tickets,
```
Suggestion: Use this 5 Class selection on 2 Rogues, 3 Mages.
Reason:
2 Rogues are for Deifying to Mikaela & HellHawk,
3 Mages are for gambling in hope for incanter
...
up-to-you whether u wanna follow, some will use on warrior,
in hope for some paladin. but 2 rogues is a must.
```

- A set of lvl 99 +MAX Helper Set for your class
```
  [2PCS: Weap.ATK +1636, Def.Pen +130],
  [4PCS: CDMG+180, HP+69907],
  [6PCS: ATK.SPD+42, Acc+ 98]
```

Upon purchasing that, you will be direct to character selection screen. Login your new lvl 99 Mage, you will be at season 3 lobby area. You don need to rush to proceed to season 4, you wont be able to handle them with your current strength. Instead, go back to Season 1 and start raiding all the bosses from Season 1 to Season 2. You might not able to handle Season 3 bosses but you can try to see whether you got lucky and pair with veteran player to clear them. After all the raiding in Season 1 and 2, you will get back around *1304 rubies*, now it is time to start new character and repeat these, check [Fast Rubies Earning with each Class](#fast-rubies-earning-with-each-class) for more details. You could consider spending some rubies on helper set for Rogue and Archer. Which will make things easier, else you could also just spend time in Raid Bosses to hunt them. I will just buy them for easier life =).

Here are what i have after each new character:

- Mage - Skill Build: 11 0 0 / 10 10 1 (some leftover point, just leave it)
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-003.jpg)

- Warrior - Skill Build: 11 0 0 / 10 10 7, NOTE: Dont forget to link you paladin equipment to warrior
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-004.jpg)

- Priest - Skill Build: 11 0 0 / 1 10 10, NOTE: Cancel the link of Paladin and Warr, create new link of mage and priest. Also priest might be abit hard on last 2 raid in chap 2. So just have some mental prepare =)
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-005.jpg)

- Archer - Skill Build:  11 0 0 / 10 7 10, OPTIONAL: get a helper set (300 Rubies) for your archer, make your life easier =)
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-006.jpg)

- Rogue - Skill Build: 11 0 0 / 10 5 10, OPTIONAL: get a helper set (300 Rubies) for your archer, make your life easier =)
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-007.jpg)

I had purchased helper set for Archer and Rogue, so if u never purchase then you will have around 600 rubies more than mine.


After earning all those rubies from repeating the character creating and raiding, now you should go back to your Paladin and start your Farming of essences, allies and Items. With your current strength, check out the [Grinding Ground](#grinding-ground) section for some suggestion.

Some tips for your farming, try unlocking some inventory slots for paladin and storage slots, this could help you while auto-dungeoning. Also you could think of spending 250 rubies each on Komodo Wings and Deadly Fire (total 500 rubies) which could help you to combine all the Items, cards and Gems you obtain while doing dungeons.


If you done all these in Day-1, i would say you are in good shape. Keep grinding for today and then get some rest. Move on to Day-2.

##### DAY 2 - 6
---

- DAY-2 Daily Login Reward: *600 Shoes*
- DAY-3 Daily Login Reward: *5x SSS Ally Summon Ticket*
- DAY-4 Daily Login Reward: *Essences Select Tickets*
- DAY-5 Daily Login Reward: *5 Mil Gold*
- DAY-6 Daily Login Reward: *500 Rubies*

<i>OVERVIEW: </i>

- Grind Dungeons with your Paladin for: Gold, Essences, Allies and Items (Skill Card & Magic Scrolls)
- Grind your Equipment and Myth Raid Badge for entering 6-Man Raid in Chap 3 - Myth Mode Raid

<i>TARGET: </i>

- Get lvl as high as possible for paladin and try to complete Season 3 - Normal for paladin.
- Collecting Gold and Essences to prepare for Deifying
- Collection Ally fodders for Enhancing & Deifying
- Collect Skills Cards to equip on your Ally

<i>DETAILS: </i>

From Day-2 to Day-6 are about the same, grinding your Level, Golds, Items & Allies. Start this off by leveling your paladin to Lvl 99, this should took around 1 or 2 days if you keep spending like 500+ shoes daily on the suggested dungeon on Day-1.
Lets start the day with 500 shoes and see how much item i could get. I spent 500 rubies to get myself a Komodo and Deadly Fire Pet from shop. These 2 will auto savage useless items and combine all the skill cards & gems that i get while grinding. You should consider getting them for 30 days to have easier life. Here are all i have left for now after purchasing those pets and some 400 shoes (160 rubies).
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-008.jpg)

Before start grinding your level, make sure you are on the EXP Formation, by default it is the one they set when you start dragon blaze. This formation is call Solidarity of Heart. Try to Max Level it and up the position of DPS to max level. Check out [HERE](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/formation-guide) for all formation info. After Max-ing your Solidarity of Heart, you should consider buying a formation call *Fire Support*, it is the most used offensive formation that is meta in all content of the game.

For the grinding spot, i choose `Scorched Terra 9` (For Light Essences, SS & SSS earrings), it is quite easy as well as the drops is good. Now all you need to do is sit back and relax until your inventory / ally is full or the shoes had run out. Also it is better to run your shoes during global buff hours for better drop rates and some other additional buff like ally join rate up, gold rate up, etc. So do checkout your server global buff time. i Spent Day-2 on this place until i am level 80.

After reaching level 80 and before moving on to chapter 3, you could start to clear some Tower of Validation (ToV for short). With Paladin + Helper set, it is quite easy to clear Hero Mode of ToV until level 16+. This is good because there are Reward like EXP boost which is not given until Day-4. Try to get those and visit this ToV from time to time to get your rewards. I cleared till lvl 19 on Day-3 (around lvl 94 on my paladin).
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-011.jpg)

After your Paladin reach level 80, move on to Chapter 3. Paladin with Helper set are able to complete at least half way of Chapter 3 or even finish it if you have friends with DB/DS Key. Try to equip all the helper set that you had (if you bought them like me) to all your temporarily ally (Healer, Rogue, Archer). With these, you should be able to finish Season 3 Normal Difficulty without any issue. There will be some reward rubies to first time finish. But do take note that some area in chapter 3 are quite difficult without any key. You might wan to unlock all items slot and accessory slot on you paladin in order to survive them. These 3 are the hardest:

- *Watchtower of Judgement* - where you will fight Howl with Omega Buster for 1st time
- *Corridor of Sacrifice* - where you will fight Howl with Omega Buster for 2nd time
- *Hall of Past Heroes* - where you will fight with Darksoul Ragnarok, bring a helper friend with you (awaken or better the one with key)
- *Destructive Ragnarok* - Last fight with Darksoul Ragnarok, bring an helper friend with you and few scroll on standby.

On these stage, if you bring along a friend with Buster/Darksoul key, whole things will be easier. Else you might need to stock-up your resurrect scroll and Toggle Between your Paladin Mode (Atk / Healer Mode on 3rd Active) whenever u need to Heal or do DMG. I finished my Chapter 3 at level 95 (DAY-3) Without any key (just helper set and some not enhance SSS ally =), you can do it too. )
![dragon blaze beginner guide - paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/dragon-blaze-beginner-guide-v2-012.jpg)

After finished chapter 3 - normal difficulty, i would say dont move on to other difficulty for now. They hit hard. For now, go raid all the Chap 3 (Normal) Raid Bosses or go dungeon and farm some essences and ally fodder. For dungeoning spot, Checkout the [Grinding Spot](#grinding-spot) section below for suggestion.

When you are leveling your paladin, you should try to enhancing the 2 Rogues ally that are summons using Class Tix. Enhance them with ally fodder, to know more detail about enhancing, check out [Enhancing](http://dbaddiction.wikia.com/wiki/Enhancing) and [Limit Breaking](http://dbaddiction.wikia.com/wiki/Limit_Break) on DBWikia. Here are my formula for adding:

> - For Enhance SS - 3B + 7C,
       PASSED: GOOD,  
       FAILED: 1B+9C and So On
> - For Enhance SSS - 3A + 7B
        PASSED: GOOD,  
        FAILED: 1A+9B and So On
> - For Enhance Deity - 3S + 7 A/B or Use SS Robot from GA and TOV


When you have some spare tickets, you could spend them in these:
1. Start raiding Season 3 - esspecially Myth: Disgael Raid for `Badge: Freed Ragnarok` and Raid essence. Now with latest patch, all NPC Bots have Key Equip, hence it is easier to raid as well.
2. Spend them on Revenge of Belphegor - For Golds
3. Spend wisely on Arena, Guild Battle and Nebula Raid (which may be too hard, but you can try leeching other pro player)
4. Visit Tower Of Validation for some good reward.

DAY-4 onward i spent most of the time at grinding materials for Stigma and for completing Beginner mission.

-- To Summerize --

- *DAY-2* - Try to reach lvl 8X Paladin
- *DAY-3* -  Try to reach lvl 99 & Finished Chapter 3 (at least Normal Difficulty)
- *DAY-4 to DAY-6* - Hunt more essences, golds and ally fodders


Nothing much except grinding, enhancing and raiding for these 5 days. Next up Day-7

[- Back to Top -](#top)


##### DAY 7
---

Daily Login Reward: *1 Draco Deity Selection Ticket*

<i>OVERVIEW: </i>

- Finally you get a Draco Deity for FREE, use it wisely
- Complete at least Mission-2 of Beginner Mission.


<i>DRACO TIX SUMMON SUGGESTION : </i> Get a [Draco Blackaria](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-blackaria).

<i>DETAILS: </i>

On Day-7, you will get your free 7th day draco deity selection ticket. If you are following my guide, take Blackaria. She will be a great healer for you for long run as well as here Transcended Form (very faaaaaar future update from now). So with her in your team, your healing department should be more or less settled.

NOTE: if you are lucky enough to get Mercedes on your ally combine or ticket summon. Please do use her instead of Blackaria.
Here are other day-7 draco choice you could choose:
- [Deathcrown](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-deathcrown) - A good Tanker/CC/Semi-DPS. He is good for his dragon breath which could clear any buff (include invulnerable) and Taunt. A good ally to be use in arena-hero as well as dungeoning.
- [Bloodwind](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-bloodwind) - Not in use in any content of the game at the moment due to his lower stats and sub-par skillset. But he will be quite all rounder once he is able to Transcend (still quite long from now) but you will need to have ouranos when trancending.
- [Brightspark](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-brightspark) - Use widely now in Arena-Hero due to her skills and self sustain. Able to stun as well as heal her self back through her skill. Her normal atk deal splash DMG is also an added plus.



[- Back to Top -](#top)


##### AFTER DAY-7

Now after Day-7, ppl will start to wonder where should i go?
Well now you should see where you could you earn your weekly income and where you want to compete. Generally the area is divide into 2, PVE and PVP. Here are the groupings:
- PVE - Scoring against the system without fighting directly with other players
> - Dungeons
> - Tower of Validation (Buster & Hero)
> - World Bosses (Golem, Hydra & Shariet)
> - Guild Adventure
> - Revenge of Belphegor

- PVP - Directly against player in real time or against their team setup.
> - Arena (Buster & Hero)
> - Guild Battle (Buster & Hero)

Why am i mentioning this PVE & PVP focus? Mainly is because the ally needed to excel in each of them is slightly different. esspecially in case of World Bosses. World bosses need certain line up in order to score well (5% and below) such at Iota, Askr, Omega, Tiehr, Sasha, Tiel, A.Belle etc. What i suggest from my experience in this game, it would be best to focus on PVE more than PVP. PVP is quite Tickets sink for beginner and u can generally scoring quite well if you start your arena fighting at Day-1 (or just after reset). More over, GB is another area where only certain guild with best setup and best current up to date equipment are able to compete in. It will require quite an amount of tickets and time need to invest in if you want to compete in GB (also you need your guild mates to be quite well-equipped as well). So base on my point of view, *it is better as beginner to focus on PVE content rather than PVP content of the game*

###### How to Awaken your Main Character

In order to awaken, you will need to clear *Chapter 4 - Forest of Memories 5* (short form FoM-5). To reach there, you will need to clear until the end of Chapter 3 Myth. This will unlock the Airship dungeon, which will be the entry point to the chapter 4. Chapter 4 monster hit alot harder than chap 3, even those with Max buster key find them hard. So how to pass these stage? Here are some tips to get you pass these are:

- Try to get Friend that is awaken & have key on their Character
- When in dungeon, bring those friend with key (esspecially on stage FoM-5)
- On FoM-5, *IMPORTANT*: Don't summon friend at the start of dungeon. Wait after cutscene finished and you are fighting yourself, THEN you summon your friend (with Key)
- Try to clear these dungeon during Buff time (Friend Summon Duration 2x), this will help you to keep your friend longer in battle
- Of course, try to bring Resurrection Item x3 (try to unlock them for the Character you intend to play, dont be cheapo =) )

##### FAST RUBIES EARNING WITH EACH CLASS
---

This method is make use of Dragon Blaze generous rubies reward for new player and make full use of them to earn rubies for new player.
This can only be done once per account. How it is done? below is the steps

- *STEP1* : Start with a new Character, let say `PALADIN` and save up 1490 Rubies
- *STEP2* : After you obtain 1490 Rubies, create a new character, let say a `MAGE`
- *STEP3* : After progressing story until unlock 4 inv slot, go to *Shop* > *Item* tab > purchase the `Special Jar of Growth - cost 1490 Rubies` which lvl your char to 99 and unlocked all dungeon till season 3 + 5xSSS class select ticket + Helper Set (LVL 99)
- *STEP4* : Raid all the bosses from Season-1 and Season-2 area to get back `1304` Rubies.
- *STEP5* : Create another New Character of diff class e.q `PRIEST`
- *STEP6* : Start the new character and progress till unlocking 4 inv slot, go to *Shop* > *Item* tab > purchase the `Normal Jar of Growth - cost 550 Rubies` which level your char to lvl 99 and unlock all dungeon till season 3.
- *STEP7* : Raid all bosses from Season-1 and Season-2 area to get back `1304` Rubies
> NOTES: the raid need tobe done in sequence.
> [CHAPTER-1] *Komodo > Storm Tyrant > JungleFury > ShadownCrag > Deathcrown > Deus Deathcrown*
> [CHAPTER-2] *Pheonix >  Aqualis > Valmut > Ragnarok > Deus Ragnarok*
- *STEP8* : Repeat *STEP5* - *STEP7* for the rest of the class (ROGUE, WARRIOR and ARCHER)

Here is the breakdown on your amount of rubies earn if you follow this.

- EARN: 6x1304 Rubies (Season-1 & Season-2 Raid) = 7824 Rubies
- COST: 1490 Rubies
- COST: Unlocking 3 more character slots = 3x99 Rubies = 297 Rubies
- COST: 5x550 Rubies = 2750 Rubies

Total Earning: 7824 - 1490 - 2750 - 297 = `3287 Rubies`

This haven include the rubies reward from Season 3 Raid, which can be done after you are stronger.
If add those in, you still have around 6 x 666 Rubies = `3996` Rubies to be earn.

Some will argue that it is better to just spend rubies to buy shoes and clear those dungeon in each character than spent 550 rubies. I would disagree with that, main reason is because season 3 area are alot harder than season 1 and 2 and cost alot more shoes (Normal, Hero, Legend, Myth). The shoes you could get from 550 rubies is just 1300++ Shoes, which doesn't even cover the shoes cost for season 3 all modes. So it is just better to buy the special Jar of Growth Until may be when they merge all the difficulty in Season 3 area.

Here is total Shoes used if you run your character manually (without 550 rubies):

- *Chapter 1* - Total Shoes used: *256* Shoes
- *Chapter 2* - Total Shoes used: *244* Shoes, <i>this exclude shoes needed for you to auto till lvl 80 before move on to chap 3. </i> roughly around *500* shoes
- *Chapter 3* - 320 Shoes Per Difficulty, So Total: *1280* Shoes
- OVERALL: you will need around *2000* shoes to get 1 character to chapter 3 (Myth)

###### *WHAT TO GET FOR FREE DEITY AND BUSTER*

###### 1. Approach-1
> - Draco Tix : Take Greysoul & Ultimate him
> - Angel Tix : Take Mikaela & Ultimate her
> - Boden Tix : Take Drunken Falcon & Ultimate him
> - Buster Tix: Take Omega
> - *PRO*: Omega is a good key for long run. Can be use by your Main Character or Falcon. Solid Support for your team.
> - *PRO*: You are only 1 deity away from Stigma (HellHawk) and upcoming Giant Atlas (Titan Altas). If you ever in need for DPS, you could make stigma first but if u can wait, i suggest wait for atlas (coming in a month or so)
> - `CONS`: You will miss the opportunity to get Iota, which is a meta unit for WB related.


###### 2. Approach-2
> - Draco Tix : Take Greysoul & Ultimate him
> - Angel Tix : Take Mikaela & Ultimate her
> - Boden Tix : Take Drunken Falcon & Ultimate him
> - Buster Tix: Take Iota
> - *PRO*: Iota is a good key for all WB related competitions. She will still be relevant in WB through out Giant Patch until transcended.
> - *PRO*: You are only 1 deity away from Stigma (HellHawk) and upcoming Giant Atlas (Titan Altas). If you ever in need for DPS, you could make stigma first but if u can wait, i suggest wait for atlas (coming in a month or so)
> - `CONS`: Iota cant be use on ur Main Char, so u wont have any key to use in Guild Battle and Raid.
> - `CONS`: You will need to have an incanter deity ([Yvante](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/hell-gatekeeper-yvante), [Belle](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/friendly-belle-snow), [Whay]([Yvante](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/immortal-summoner-whay), [Magaret](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/margaret), or [Ravengale](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/ravengale-the-kind)) to hold this key else it idling in your storage and wasted.

###### 3. Approach-3
> - Draco Tix : Take Greysoul & Ultimate him
> - Angel Tix : Take Kymeal & Ultimate her
> - Boden Tix : Take Drunken Falcon & Ultimate him
> - Buster Tix: Take Iota
> - *PRO*: Iota is a good key for all WB related competitions. She will still be relevant in WB through out Giant Patch until transcended.
> - *PRO*: With both kymeal and falcon, you are 1 deity (howl) away from Omega key. Spend 10 SSS to make Howl and u get your omega key
> - *PRO*: With both Iota and Omega, your buffer area is quite covered. Make Mikaela (10 SSS) & Preparing another SSS rogue for either HellHawk or Titan Atlas, to complete get stigma or atlas. and with that your DPS covered
> - *PRO*: This approach will give you more Keys (Iota, Omega, Stigma / Atlas or Both )
> - `CONS`: More resources needed

###### 4. Preparing for Trans
> - Draco Tix : Take Bloodwind & Ult him
> - Angel Tix : Take Llywelyn & Ult her
> - Boden Tix : Take Arrow Trigger & Ult her
> - Buster Tix: Take Epsilon
> - DAY-7 Tix: Take Blackaria
> - This will ensure you with Bloodwind and Ouranos Key which will be used for transcending T.Bloodwind, as well as Epsilon & Blackaria for T.Blackaria.
> - *PRO*: Those 2 are the tops Transcended from Dracos, esspecially T.Blackaria which until now is still meta in almost all contents
> - `CONS`: You will lose out in all PVE content. Ouranos & Epsilon is still quite OK in PVP area (if you play your arena early)
> - *NOTE*: Some other transcended you could plan, here is their pros and cons [LINK](https://dbkrblog.wordpress.com/2016/10/12/the-transcended-pros-and-cons/)
> - Another thing would be if you really wan to start a new and aiming for trans, you also need to start hunting and accumulating alot of Light & Hero essences.

##### DO AND DONT
---

Dragon blaze is the only 1 game i know that gives out so much in-game cash (Rubies) for beginner. But great amount of rubies also will somehow make player spent them in bad way. Here are some Dos and Donts as new player playing this game.

###### `DOs`

- Focus on Ultimating 1 Deity / Key compare to have a team with +0 Deity / Key.
- Focus on Ultimating DPS first then Support Unit (Healer / Buffer / Tank)
- Do your dailies and get your reward
- Join a guild - this will give you access to `Guild Adventur` & `Guild Battle` (More rubies income)
- Find out what is the reset day for Arena and do as much as you could in day-1 after reset to net your better ranking
- In arena, choose your opponent wisely, if cant win, reset the list by exit and then go in again to arena.
- Unlock accessory, items and inventory slots for your main character. Usually ppl play Paladin and Priest as Main (Meaning can be use in all area of the game).  
- Buy some formation, best all rounder formation now is `Fire Support`
- Use rubies on Shoes is the best course of action.
- Buy Essences only if you are desperately needing them
- Summon Ally only when there is Summoning Event Bonus 1+1. On this event, when you use summon ally package (300 rubies) from shop, each bonus you get (3A -> get an S, 3S -> get an SS and so on) would be doubled. Meaning instead of 1 bonus, you get 2 bonud (2S, 2SS, 2SSS)



###### `DONTs`

- Dont buy costume (Character & Ally). They are quite useless other than looking good. There are better way to spend your rubies.
- Dont use SS Allies as Fodder to enhance SSS/Deity Units, use them to make SSS instead
- Dont rush, as new player, you cant expecting to be scoring 10% in every area of the game like 1 or 2 weeks. Give or take a month or more to reach around 10% in certain area.

##### TIPS AND TRICKS
---

###### 1. How to master ally rapport easily

- First you will need a paladin (coz of his 1st active AoE & low CoolDown)
- Include all 4 ally slot with allies that you wan to master their rapport
- Go so Chapter 2 - Spider Vine 5
- Repeat the round until all rapport are mastered - usually around 3 round
- with that, after 3 rounds (6 shoes cost), you get 4x allies rapport mastered (40 Rubies)

###### 2. Gold Earning

- Best Way: get an gold accessory usually from Drop Event
- If you dont have Gold Accessory, you could earn gold by running Revenge of Belphegor on Repeat overnight.
- For those player that could reach RoB - Round 6 on Auto, your ticket used will be regen back by the time you finished 1 run.
- Hence, you could almost run RoB forever without depleting much ticket.
- Per night (usually i run from 1 am - 7+ am), i could earn near to 5 Million Gold.

###### 3. When to change Helper Set?

- Helper set should last you till you are in chapter 3
- Try to hunt for raid in chapter 3 (myth) for Freed Ragnarok Badge
- Then change your set to Freed Ragnarok Set (U Grade)
- Another option is to raid for Chapter 4 Boreas, which is inferior to freed ragna and it is harder as well.
