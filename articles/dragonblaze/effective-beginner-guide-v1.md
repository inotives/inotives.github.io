#### Effective Starting Guide for New Player of Dragon Blaze

---

<pre class="red lighten-2">
THIS GUIDE GONNA BE UPDATE SOON WHEN CHAPTER 4 IS RELEASED (prob on Dec 6th). LOOK FORWARD TO IT =D.
Please do not follow the ally recommendation on this guide, as more awakens are Available now,
you can get some better allies choices than the one i recommends on this guide.
</pre>

This approach of starting the game is kinda slow, but it will give you a very good foundation later on. If you follow to the end of this tutorial, you will have:

- around 10 Million GOLD,
- 10k - 11k Rubies,
- lots of Allies (SSS and Fodders)
- gems, essences, item fodders.


##### Choosing New Character
When you first started Dragon blaze, you will be given 3 character slot for free. Use these 3 slots wisely will get you with a good start in game,
here are my suggestion:

- Create a `Priest` as your first character, level it & earn up to `990 rubies`.
- Then make a `Paladin` next as second character and use 990 rubies on a special pot (more detail on this later on)

Why this 2 character? They are the most used character in the current Dragon Blaze content. Priest char is use in *World Bosses* and *Arena*. Paladin is used in *Arena*, *Guild Battle* and *Raid*. If you started as these 2 character, you can almost cover the needs in all area of the game. Checkout their skill build in [Character Section](/game/dragon-blaze/char). For priest, you should go for Magnify Build and for paladin you can go for Sword-Pally or Fist Build.
3rd Character slot can be used as storage character or anything you wanna try out but if you follow my method, you will create all 6 characters anyway.


##### How to advance ( Day-by-Day )

I will breakdown this section to Day-by-Day to give you the idea on what to accomplished in each day on Dragon Blaze until you have graduated (DAY 7).


###### - DAY 1 -

If you just started Dragon Blaze, after the first character is created, you will prompt to enter a Referral, this will allow you to earn 50 Rubies (for you and referral) once you had reach LVL 20. If you are playing in SEA Server, you could put me as referral (IGN: *Kazudin*). Once you had created your first char (Priest), proceed to start the game and you will be put through series of tutorial to let u familiar with the game. Once you have the control, you will be given new player attendance reward.
![dragon-blaze-attendance-reward-day-1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-attendance-reward.jpg)
OK, now you got your first day reward which is a very rare `Hero Selection Ticket` that let you choose 1 SSS awakenable Ally of your choice. I would save that ticket first and use it on DAY 7. Why? well, because along the way, you will get more SSS ally and depend on how your luck and RNG, the choice for your Hero Selection will need to change accordingly.

What you need to do on Day 1 basically level-up your priest and collect Rubies reward along the way till you had 990 Rubies. I am using `Magnify build` for my priest which allocate all skill points to second active and passive 1, 2 & 3 (check [Character Detail Page](/game/dragon-blaze/char/priest) for other priest build ). This build is most popular priest build at the moment, can be used in various content especially World Bosses.
Below are list of things you could do to obtain rubies.

- Reach LVL 10 - Reward: *5 Rubies*
- Reach LVL 20 - Reward: *20 Rubies* + *100 Rubies*
- Reach LVL 30 - Reward: *60 Rubies*
- Reach LVL 40 - Reward: *120 Rubies* + *100 Rubies*
- Complete Chapter 19 - Reward: *12 Rubies*
- Complete Chapter 23 - Reward: *17 Rubies*
- Join a Guild or Create One - Reward: *12 Rubies*
- Clear Komodo Fairy Raid - Reward: *63 Rubies*
- Clear Storm Tyrant Fairy Raid - Reward: *76 Rubies*
- Clear Junglefury Fairy Raid - Reward: *89 Rubies*
- Clear Shadowcrag Fairy Raid - Reward: *102 Rubies*
- Enter Arena Once (lvl.25) - Reward: *100 Rubies*
- Participate in Hero Arena (lvl.25) - Reward: *50 Rubies*
- Participate in Buster Arena (lvl.25) - Reward: *50 Rubies*
- World Boss For the 1st Time (Golem/Hydra/Shari) - Reward: *100 Rubies*
- Challenge World Boss - Reward: *20 Rubies*

When you reach lvl 40, you should have close to 990 rubies. if you haven't, proceed to MASTER some rapport of the allies u have for 10 rubies each.
It took me around half a day to level my new priest to lvl 40 and collected enough rubies (990) to continue on a second character - *PALADIN*.
![dragon-blaze-lvl-40-priest](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-priest-lvl-40.jpg)

So now you have 990 rubies, go back to your character selection screen and create a new character: `PALADIN`.
![dragon-blaze-create-new-lvl1-paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-paladin-lvl-1.jpg)
Start off that character and goes through the tutorial again until the part where they unlock the inventory slot for you.
Next go to *shop* > *item* > Buy the `Special Jar of Growth` for 990 Rubies (only can purchase once per account). This will give you:

- lvl your paladin to lvl 80 straight & unlock all stages up to chapter 2
- 3 X SSS Class Selection Tickets
- 1 Fullset Helper Equipment (+MAX) for Paladin

Once you had purchase it, you will be brought to character selection screen and you should have your lvl 80 paladin. Start that character, you will be greeted in chapter 2 lobby. After the conversation, open up your paladin skill. Use the following skill setup. This setup is good for raiding and advance the dungeon for the next 2 days.
![dragon-blaze-paladin-skill-build](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-paladin-skill-built.jpg)
After adding the skills, remember to take your helper set from your mail. Equip them to your paladin and head to chapter 1 to clear all the raids here to gain back some rubies (*539 Rubies*). They need to be clear by sequence (Komodo > Storm > Junglefury > Shadow > Deathcrown > Deus DDC). Then head to chapter 2 and clear all the raids (*765 Rubies*) by sequence (Pheonix > Aqualis > Valmut > Ragnarok > Deus Ragnarok - 6 man raid ). Now you should have 1.3k+ Rubies.
Here is what i had after finished all the raid.
![dragon-blaze-lvl-80-paladin](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-paladin-lvl-80.jpg)
Next up for today will be to focus on leveling your current ally to lvl 80 and get some equipment for your ally. I would suggest you purchase a dragon pet - `Dark Fury` (*250 Rubies*) for auto-raiding and expand your storages to `64 slots` (*348 Rubies*) trust me, these investment will worthwhile in long run. if you dont wan to spend these is also OK, but u will ned to press the raid yourself and clear the inventory often.

Next proceed to open your 3 x Class selection tickets, I would choose to get 1 Warrior first (pray to RNG for a paladin), 2 x Priest ally. here was what i got.
![dragon-blaze-class-tickets-ally-draw](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-ally-draw-1.jpg)
Consider not bad, 2 awakenable allies (although no paladin ... oh well .... ). I will try to ultimate shabelle and awakened her as she is one of the ingredient for [Darksoul-Shiva](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-shiva). As for Ackard, i think i will keep him for now (ally needed for  [Darksoul-Ragnarok](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-ragnarok)), i might deify him to [StormBear](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/storm-bear-the-iron-wall) as my main tanker. Why choose 1 war, 2 priest? Coz if the warrior you got is a paladin, you could aim for [Buster-OMEGA](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dragon-buster-omega). These could effect what choices you made on your hero selection tix. More on this tactic later on. Lets hope i could get some more good allies on my Day 3 ally draw. (you can check which ally can be awakened at [Dragon Blaze Ally Page](/game/dragon-blaze/ally)).
Here are the list of good to make key that you should aim for. Take a look at current [DB-Global tier list](/game/dragon-blaze/dbg-global-tier-list) as well.

Now for the rest of the Day-1, just focus on raiding in chapter 2 - Ragnarok Raid to gear up your current allies and Master rapport for any new Ally encounter and get some light essences. You could also change the raid essences obtained from ragnarok raid for deus badge and get some equipment there. Try to buy some shoes and run it on Daily Buff hours. I bought around 2 x 100 shoes on 100% drop rates.

Here are what my progress at the end of Day-1
![dragon-blaze-end-day-1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-paladin-end-day-1.jpg)


###### - DAY 2 -

Now on Day 2, you should have a lvl 80 Paladin ready. Today you will get your Day 2 attendance reward of 300 Shoes. Safe it for now, use it during the buff hours to level-up your paladin. One important tips, remember to complete all your daily quest, this will give you 8 rubies daily which is around 56 rubies per week. [HERE](//game/dragon-blaze/reward-calculator) is the tool i made to let you calculate your rubies income weekly.
![dragon blaze attendance reward day 2](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-attendance-reward-day-2.jpg)

Try to enhance your SSS ally. in my case, i will enhance my Shabelle. Here are the [LINK](http://dbaddiction.wikia.com/wiki/Enhancing) to how to enhance effectively.
Once you are gear-up, you could try to advance to Chapter 3. But before that, go to last stage of chapter 2 - Scorched Terra 9. Finished it once, to get `1500 Rubies`.
![dragon blaze clear chapter 2 reward](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-clear-chp-2-reward.jpg)

After gotten the big sum of rubies (feeling rich now), head toward the stage pointed by helper pointer to get to the chapter 3. On that stage there will be a small guardian boss, it you gear your ally well, this small boss should be nothing. After the fight, welcome to Chapter 3. Yay!.
The mobs here hit alot... harder. if you cant handle, go back to chapter 2 area and gear up there. Try to enhance your allies and equipment.
Some suggestion on where to hunt lvl and drops in chap.2 :  

- Infernal Fortress Outer Wall 5 - Drops: `SSS Necklace lvl.74`
- Infernal Fortress Inner Wall 7 - Drops: `SSS Ring lvl.83`
- Scorched Terra 9 - Drops: `SSS Earring lvl.78`

One notes, use your shoes in mail during the buff hours (+100% drops and +70% EXP) for best result.

My Day-2 was WB-Hydra day, try fighting him once, you will get `100 rubies` for first time and `20 rubies` for participation.
Leveling and Raiding in chapter 2 area for now. Choose those red stages with accessories and ess drop. You will need so accessories in order to make you and your allies stronger. Here is what my progress at the end of Day-2
![day-2-end](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-paladin-end-day-2.jpg)


###### - DAY 3 -
On Day 3, your will get 2x SSS Ally tickets. Use them and hope RNG GOD be with you. Here are what i got.
![day-3-reward-allies](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-paladin-day-2-reward-allies.jpg)
RNG GOD not blessing me .... hope you have better luck than me. Well life goes on...
Here is what i planned for today:

- Continue Raiding Ragnarok and Deus Raganarok for equipment.
- Running Dungeon at Infernal Fort Inner wall 7 for Rings and Essences.
- Leveling up my paladin to LVL 90 by spending rubies on Shoes during buff hours.

Focus on getting your equipment ready as top priority. This will make your life later on much much more easier. Don't need to rush to chapter 3, you cant advanced much with the ally and gear you had.
I spend around 700 shoes (300 shoes for day-2 reward, 400 shoes purchased) during buff hours to lvl my paladin from 83 to 90. During leveling, i managed to get quite a numbers of light ess, ally fodders, item fodders and golds. Here what i got:
![dragon blaze day 3 loot after dungeoning](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-paladin-day-2-loot-after-90.jpg)
27 light essences was not bad. it will cost me around 500+ rubies if i direct purchase those essences. Some Pro-Tips for F2P `Always use Rubies on SHOES !!`.
I used some of the rubies to unlock all my item slots and accessory slots.
Here was what i end with at the end of day-3
![dragon blaze day 3 end](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-paladin-end-day-3.jpg)


###### - DAY 4 -
Now at Day 4, your will get a 7 Days EXP Booster. This will be the start of farming live... OK here are the plan:

- Use the exp booster and level-up your priest up to level 80.
- After the priest had reached lvl 80, Clear all the raids from chapter 1 to Chapter 2. This will get you alot of rubies.
- create another character(archer/warrior/rogue/mage) on slot 3. level up that character to 80 and clear all the raids as well.
- Now, unlocked another character slot (99 rubies) and create another character which is not the first 3 character you had created.
- Level that new char to lvl 80 and clear all the raids for rubies.
- Repeat for the remaining 2 characters that you haven created.

`Use your rubies to purchase shoes for leveling`. You will ask Why not use the 550 Rubies - Jar of Growth? Well that is `Up-To-You`. If you want to speed things up and don't mind paying the rubies, by all mean do it. My reason of not using it, is because for 550 rubies you could get 1300+ shoes. It was more than enough to get you to complete chap 2 as well as lvl 80, and along the way, you could get Gold, Allies, Gems and Essences. When you factor in all these, the Jar of Growth is really a waste of rubies (but save time).

When leveling priest, you will get reward for every 10 level. I stopped at lvl 40 on my priest, today i will try to level my priest to lvl 80 to get all the reward. Here are the reward list for each level (check out my [Beginner Reward List](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/beginner-quest-reward-list) post for details ):

- Level 50 - Reward: *SSS Ally Ticket x 1 & 250 Rubies*
- Level 60 - Reward: *200 Rubies & 280 Rubies*
- Level 70 - Reward: *SSS Ally Ticket x 1 & 300 Rubies*
- Level 80 - Reward: *200 Rubies, 150k Gold & 320 Rubies*

When leveling, if you notice, your tickets and shoes will increase by 2 when level up. use this to your advantage and switch back to paladin and do some raiding when your ticket is full. There are reward for completing each chapter for the first time (check out my [Beginner Reward List](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/beginner-quest-reward-list) post for full reward list. ). I bought 300 shoes (160 Rubies) to level-up my priest to lvl 80. These was what i got after lvl my priest to 80 and complete all stages in season 1 & 2.
![dragon blaze day 4 end](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-priest-lvl-80.jpg)
Next i will create and level-up a new character on my 3rd slot. I decided to create an [Archer](/game/dragon-blaze/char/archer). I like her character design the most (due to elf).
![dragon blaze day 4 end](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-archer-start.jpg)
What u decided to level up on 3rd slot is up to you. I will start leveling this new character next day. For the rest of today, i will just do raiding to gear up all my allies. Here was my progress so far.




###### - DAY 5 -

Day 5, you will get 300k Gold as attendance reward. Continue to level-up your new characters to lvl 80 and do all the raids once if you have not done it yet.
Today, i will level up my 3rd character - [Archer](/game/dragon-blaze/char/archer), and claim all the raid rewards.
i had used 600 shoes (240 Rubies) to complete all dungeons in season 1 & 2 and lvl my archer to 80. These was what i have after completed all raids on my archer.
![dragon blaze day 5 archer lvl 80](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-archer-lvl-80.jpg)

Next, unlocked another character slot with 99 rubies and create a new character. in my case, i gonna create a [Rogue](/game/dragon-blaze/char/rogue)
![dragon blaze day 5 rogue lvl 1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-rogue-lvl-1.jpg)
I decided will do raids for the rest of today to complete my sets for allies.



###### - DAY 6 -
Day-6, 500 Rubies from attendance reward. Gonna continue where i left off and leveling my rogue. Spent around 600 shoes to level my rogue to level 80. Here are what i got after level him to 80 and completed all the raids.
![dragon blaze day 6 rogue lvl 80](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-rogue-lvl-80.jpg)
Next up, unlock another new slot and create a [Mage](/game/dragon-blaze/char/mage).
![dragon blaze day 6 mage lvl 1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-mage-lvl-1.jpg)
after another 600 shoes, mage was lvl 80. Here is what i got after completed all the raids for mage.
![dragon blaze day 6 mage lvl 80](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-mage-lvl-80.jpg)
Lastly i will create a warrior, i don think i have time to level it anymore (lvl-80 for 2 chars was my limit.).
![dragon blaze day 6 warrior lvl 1](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-warrior-lvl-1.jpg)

I will continue to level this char tomorrow.



###### - DAY 7 -
Day-7, the day that you get your free Draco Summon Ticket. You will ask, what should i choose?. Well it depends on what your current team composition.
Here are a few good team composition for new player:

- 1 Healer, 1 Tank, 3 DPS
- 1 Tank, 2 Healer, 2 DPS

The class you gonna play, what you got for your free SSS, will effect which draco you choose to maximize your team potential. Here are my strategies:

| Conditions     | Choice         | Reason |
| :------------- | :------------- | :-------------|
| Any Character except priest, Don have Mercedes / Shabelle | [Draco-Blackaria](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-blackaria) | Blackaria is one of the best in game healer, without doubt she could help you get through some of the dungeon in story mode. |
| Character-DPS (Paladin-DPS, Mage, Rogue, Archer) AND Have Shabelle / Mercedes | [Draco Deathcrown](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-deathcrown) | Your main char DPS are quite ok to get you through for now, and you have a good awakenable healer, try to awaken them as soon as possible. what you need in your team now is a good tanker. Draco Deathcrown is a good tank as well as deal quite an amount of DMG. |
| Character-Priest AND have Shabelle / Mercedes | [Draco Brightspark](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-brightspark) | Your main is healer and you have another awaken-able good healer, your choice would be a Tank or a DPS. Best DPS of draco should be [Brightspark](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-brightspark) and with her latest balanced, she is even more deadly. for tank, if you follow what i did in this tutorial, you could deify your warrior to [StormBear](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/storm-bear-the-iron-wall). He is one of the best Tanker to have at the moment.|

For the Draco ticket, i chose [Draco Brightspark](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-brightspark). I had a good SSS tank ally, a good enough healer with resurrect, all i need is more DPS to help me clear the mobs in season 3 (i used this setup to clear season 3 without key-unit, detail in [Here](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/how-to-beat-season-3-without-key-unit) )

As for the hero selection ticket, it is depend on what your aim for the dark-soul. example if you have a Loki and Lucienne, you should use your hero tix to get fulson and complete [Tiehr](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-tiehr). The choice of dark soul is really up to you. If you are lucky enough to get a Tiel, be sure to safe it for later. she is really hard to come by and the dark-soul she could make is very good ([Askr](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-askr)).

If you ask for my opinion, i would say get a Tinulvian and awaken her to: [Tinulvian the Poison Fang](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/tinulvian-the-poison-fang). She is the best DPS in dungeon at the moment. When she is max and proper geared, she will help alot when u are advancing in season 3 area. Whether to make [Thanatos](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-thanatos) is up to you, He is a good key if you are aiming in PVP contents (GB especially).
After spending close to 600 Shoes, My warrior was finally lvl-80. Here is what i got after all the raids is completed.
![dragon blaze day 7 warrior lvl 80](/articles/dragonblaze/images/effective-beginner-guide-warrior-lvl-80.jpg)

##### Where to go from here?

Now, you have a lot of rubies, what to do with them? Here are a few choices you could make.

1. Keep using your rubies for Shoes to get allies fodder, essences and gold. Combine A and S allies your self using B ally + C ally fodder.
2. Use your rubies on 10x Ally summon (best to summon when there is 1+1 event). It will guarantee SS on the 10th ally.
3. Buy some essences (especially Hero essences) to create and enhances your heroes ally.

Try to create 1 `Max Dark soul` (or Dragon Buster although i would not suggest because they are getting weaker and weaker ), and try to reach Destruction Ragnarok Raid and farm those equipment as replacement for your Ragnarok & Deus Ragnarok. That raid need at least a Key-Unit or else your will die a lot, if your are raiding without key, do remember to bring some revival order (30 rubies for 100 scroll) for better chance of survival. Season 3 area are difficult for new player, check out my guide on [How to beat Season 3 Area](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/how-to-beat-season-3) for some insight and tips to get through.


Check out my next post, [Focus Area For Beginner](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/beginner-focus-area) to decide where you should focus on to get your rubies income.
