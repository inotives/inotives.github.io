##### ARENA
---

Due to last week release of the `Giant Key` the meta shifted to those 2 keys. So in Arena Buster, those team with these 2 keys will have major advantages. With the Thetys in picture, Morgana curses was history as well as Ragnarok Death Rampages (due to thetys healings). Most used formation in buster mode is still `Fire Support` as it provides the most DMG boost for all allies.

In Heroes mode, the thetys and atlas was meta unit as well. But old meta such as tiel, turq, eirden, karang were still strong fighter in arena. Most used formation is `Fire Support` with some sighting or `Patient Chivalry` and `Protection of Heaven`.

##### WORLD BOSSES
---

With the introduce of Thetis key, the meta on world boss had shifted again. Belle would be left out by some other ppl and formation with 3 buffer+healer are introduced. But the majority of the score is still depend on the RNG by the key summon by Sasha. Weapon effects used for this week are mostly 2xCDR. 1CDR+1DOT might be useful for DPS unit. For skill card, DPS is using Boss DMG dual card, Support unit are using ATK.SPD related cards.

###### >> GOLEM - Suggestion & Line-up

Some new line-up for this world boss this week include triple Healer (Priest, Thetis and Thetis-Key ). Some player i knew, drop falcon and use paly MC instead of priest MC for constant dmg Boost (due to golem clearing buff at the late game). But mostly the score range is very big due to the nature of RNG by our DPS - Sasha. Formation wise, `Fire Support` still the best in this.

Here are some line-up i used and saw others using:

- Paladin+Askr, Whay+Sasha, Yvante+Iota, Lucienne+Tiehr, Tiel+Omega, *HELPER*: Belle, Thetis+Thetis
- Priest+Shiva(1%), Whay+Sasha, Yvante+Iota, Lucienne+Tiehr, Tiel+Askr, *HELPER*: Falcon+Omega, Thetis+Thetis  
- Priest+Shiva(1%), Whay+Sasha, Yvante+Iota, Belle, Tiel+Askr, *HELPER*: Falcon+Omega, Thetis+Thetis

###### >> Hydra - Suggestion & Line-up

Same as golem, due to thetis, the meta shifted abit. In hydra, due to multiple target heads of this boss, some ppl use boss card on Thetis carry (Mercedes would be best). Tiehr still able to crunch alot of DMG to hydra and major decision factor of your rank still depend on who Sasha summons (I HATE U, RNG .....)


Here are some line-up i used and saw others using:
- Priest+Shiva(1%), Whay+Sasha, Mercedes+Thetis, Lucienne+Tiehr, Tiel+Askr, *HELPER*: Falcon+Omega, Yvante+Iota
- Paladin+Askr, Whay+Sasha, Mercedes+Thetis, Lucienne+Tiehr, Tiel+Omega, *HELPER*: Thetis+Shiva(1%), Yvante+Iota


###### >> Shariet - Suggestion & Line-up

This boss is the odd one out. You will need to stack as much buffer and healer as possible to keep the varman's family alive to crunch DMG. With Thetis, their survivality increase so she is the new meta player in this. Weapon effects on this boss is slightly different as well. it is best to use DEF.Down effect as much as possible on all the units. So best is to have CDR+Def.Down on ALL unit u are using. Formation wise, Defensive formation such as `Heavenly Protection` and `Holy Protection` are good to use.

- Priest+Shiva(1%), Whay+Sasha, Falcon+Omega, Tiel+Askr, Shabelle+Thetis, *HELPER*: Thetis+Epsilon(1%), Yvante+Iota *FORMATION*: Holy Protection or Heaven Protection
- Paladin+Askr, Whay+Sasha, Yvante+Iota, Shabelle+Thetis, Tethis+Epsilon(1%) *HELPER*: Belle, Tiel+Omega *FORMATION*: Fire Support (put thetis key at Normal DPS position to boost heals)



##### GUILD BATTLES
---

OK, in GB, due to new key, they are basically the newest meta here. Morgana and Ragna was render quite useless against thetis. Personally i think Thetis is more crucial compare to Atlas. Atlas Andromena punch is good, but seldom success. Atlas stuns is what she is good. But atlas stuns and out of battlefield punch can be reflected by thetis, that why i personally think Thetis is more meta than Atlas.

###### Guild Battle - Buster Suggestion
- Atlas x2, Thetis x2
- Askr, Atlas x2, Thetis
- Askr, Atlas, Tiehr, Thetis
- Askr, Shiva, Atlas, Thetis

###### Guild Battle - Heroes Suggestion
- Fist Pally x2, Sheep Mage x2
- Fist Pally x2, Sheep Mage, Meteor Mage
- RoA Archer, Fist Pally x2, Sheep Mage
- RoA Archer, Sheep Mage, Meteor Mage, Fist Paladin


##### GUILD ADVENTURES
---

Generally guild adventures work the same as golem, so the line up in golem can be re-use over here (less 1 helper). One notes, Pally would be best performer here compare to priest. This is because priest will lose the first magnify (if u auto it) when all the key are transforming and each round of the GA is quite short (if ur guild have many heavy hitter). It is better to use pally which the buff is permanent on the field even when all the keys are transforming. Formation wise, `Fire Support` is the best you got.

My Line up suggestion:

- Paladin+Askr, Lucienne+Tiehr, Whay+Sasha, Yvante+Iota, Tiel+Omega, *HELPER*: Thetis+Thetis  
- Paladin+Askr, Whay+Sasha, Yvante+Iota, Belle, Tiel+Omega, *HELPER*: Thetis+Thetis  
- Priest+Shiva(1%), Whay+Sasha, Yvante+Iota, Tiel+Askr, Lucienne+Tiehr, *HELPER*: Thethis+Thetis
- Priest+Shiva(1%), Whay+Sasha, Yvante+Iota, Tiel+Askr, Belle, *HELPER*: Thethis+Thetis


##### REVENGE OF BELPHEGOR
---

How to do RoB? simple, just `AUTO-RUN` it every night before sleep. This way, you could earn gold (for me that can reach R-6, Wave-7 each night can earn 5 millions+), and clear the RoB till Round 6. After you done till round 6, just need to start a couple of round from Round 6 (Cost 5 Tickets) and try to clear it.
Usually units that have high survivality skills & Crowd-Control Skill like Heals, Life Steal, Stuns, Silence are preferred. Formation wise, you could use `Fire Support` for bursting through or `Heaven Protection` for more survivality (but there are risk of timeout)

Here are some of my suggestion:
- MAIN: Priest+Shiva, Thetis+Thetis, Lucienne+Tiehr, Tiel+Askr, Whay+Shasha,
- MAIN: Priest+Shiva, Thetis+Thetis, Lucienne+Atlas, Tiel+Askr, Whay+Shasha,
- MAIN: Priest+Shiva, Thetis+Thetis, Gaia/Ouranos, Tiel+Askr, Omega,


##### SUMMARY

So in summary, this week due to the arrival of Giant Key, most of the meta was shifted and GB are the most affected by this shift. Last week, the ranging champion Morgana and Ragnarok was basically get kicked out of their job. Belle usage in WB is almost at its end as well.

This is my first analysis logs, if there are something i miss out, let me know on comments.
