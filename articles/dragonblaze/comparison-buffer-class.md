      She was the earliest SSS ally buffer used in WB. She was used until recently in Shariet as helper buffer. Most of the player kept her at ultimate not only as helper buffer also because she could be awakened to a more powerful <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/deity/friendly-belle-snow"> Friendly Belle Snow.</a>.

      Her main selling point is her ATK and ATK.SPD buffs which could be stack up to 2 if you use 2xCDR on her. Main buffer ally that is used till now in every world boss, but soon gonna get replace by awakened belle snow when she is released in Global. She is gonna be used as ingredient for Transcended Raven in far future. She usually build to be tanky meaning give her more HP, Def and Eva. Be to use ATK.SPD card on her to trigger CDR faster hence more buffs.

      Azur is an interesting ally. Although he is a warrior type ally, but his skill set is more toward buffer type (which usually is INT type). He has a buff which increase team overall ATK by 40% and C.DMG by 70 with long duration and low CD, if equip with CDR weapon, this buff could be stack 2x. Both of his passive also increase pt dmg output. And finally his auto atk def down debuff is a good addition to deal more dmg to target.
