#### How to beat Season 3

---

Most of the new players will stuck in Season 3 Area for quite long and some area are very hard to pass without Key Unit (Buster or Darksoul). This article will teach you a way to pass those area with certain setup and allies. Before reading this, your should have read the [Effective Beginner Guide](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/effective-beginner-guide), This is kinda a continuation from where i left off on that guide.

Some pre-requisite:

- Paladin with First Active ULT Build (11/x/10, 12/x/0/10) and must be lvl 90 and Unlock all 3 Accessory slot and Item slots.
- Must have [Tinulvian the Poison Fang](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/tinulvian-the-poison-fang) enhance till MAX or even ULT
- Get [Draco Brightspark](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-brightspark) from your Day-7 Reward.
- 1 Healers with Ressurect Skill
- 1 Tanker
- All of your ally should be with Ragnarok equipment at least or Deus Ragna equipment (even better).
- Try to get some friend with Key

The gist of this tactic is to make Tinulvian as the main DPS carry and Brightspark as support and second DPS while the rest of the team is healer and tanker. Below are the explanation of their role in this tactic.

| Char/Ally                      | Their Job      |
| :----------------------------- | :------------- |
| [Paladin](/game/dragon-blaze/char/paladin) (Defense Stance) | Paladin will be AoE healer for the team (using the following build: *11 / x / 10, 12 / x / 0 / 10*). His first active when ultimate will become a mass heal along with his super defensive and defensive aura buff, your team will be in good hand. Usually paladin will be the last to die, use the rezz scroll when he is the last on standing.  |
| [Tinulvian the Poison Fang](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/tinulvian-the-poison-fang) | She will be the main killer for your team. Her poison can clear off mobs quite effectively. Just need to keep reviving her if she is down. |
| [Draco Brightspark](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-brightspark) | a very good DPS, her normal atk is splash DMG make her a good killer. Her life steal skill + stun make her a good crowd control and could be life saving in some critical moment. She will be second DPS in this party. |
| A Healer with Resurrect | Any healer will be fine, will be better if you have deity-tier healer such as blackaria, mercedes, shabelle. Their heal is good but they tend to die off very fast (almost 1-shotted at shadow castle area), just need them to resurrect and support heal.  |
| A Tanker (Best will be [StormBear](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/storm-bear-the-iron-wall)) | Main tanker for the party. Tank DMG and give taunt to shield DPS and Healer from mobs. By far Stormbear is the best in this due to his immortality skill. His Reflect DMG is also good to have. |


Here is how my team looks like:
![team composition](/articles/dragonblaze/images/how-to-beat-season-3-pic01.jpg)

During Battle, your paladin will be in defensive stances, this will boost your team defense and AoE heal whole party every 7 sec. With this setup, Ancient Landing and Fiery land area should not be much issue. The hard part will only come in when you reach Ivory Grave Ruins area. The mobs here hits quite hard, but still quite manageable, some stages u might need to use resurrect scroll.

##### Where to Grind as New Player for Essences?

Usually when you can get pass certain area, meaning you need to go back a little bit and start grinding for items and ally fodder to enhance your ally and their equipments.
Also in order to enhance deity level ally, you will need to have essences. This question will come to your mind *Where could i grind for best items and essences?* Here are list of area that you could choose to grind and hunt.

###### 1. Froze Ruins 9 <i><small>(best place for Hero Essences for New Player)</small></i>

Personally i prefer this stage for grinding as new player. Part of the reason is the mobs are not as pain as other stage that drops Heroes essences.
Most of the mobs here hit single target and alot of priest mobs. Make them easy to kill. I tried with 2 priest, 2 DPS and 1 Healer Pally formation, I could fully auto this stage.
![dragon blaze shadow castle area](/articles/dragonblaze/images/how-to-beat-season-3-pic05.jpg)

Some downside for this stage is there are no accessories item drop in this stage. If you could sustain the DMG, you could try

- *Demonic Crater 9* for lvl 88 Rings (Max Stats is 107)
- *Icy Fang 9* for lvl 88 Earring (Max ATK.SPD 17)


###### 2. Ancient's Landing Area <i><small>(for Light Essences)</small></i>

If you are following my setup, auto dungeoning in the Ancient's Landing area on Season 3 should not be a problem. There are certain area here that are more profitable due to the drops of accessories as well as light essences. Here are some of my suggestion.

- *Beach of the Dead 5* for Rings which max stats is 102
- *Ancient Grave 4 & 7* for Earrings which max atk.spd is 17
- *Windy Hill 9* For Necklace which mostly used by priest and buffers.



##### Last Area of Season 3 - Shadow Castle

The nightmare will start  once you reach Shadow Castle Area
![dragon blaze shadow castle area](/articles/dragonblaze/images/how-to-beat-season-3-pic02.jpg)
The mobs here hits very hard. You will need to scroll few times every stage. But it is not impossible to pass these area. I am able to pass each stage here with the help of scrolls and time the skills on Tinulvian and Brightspark. Some stage do require the help of friends with Key (buster/darksoul).

###### 3rd Last Stage: Watchtower of Judgement

Remember to pot only when you are the only one left, or your Tinulvian is down. This tactic required tinulvian to constant poison the crowds and let them die from that. Something you need to be careful is those summoner will summon out imps that could explode, usually when it explode, only my paladin will be left standing. quickly ress back your ally. you need to time the timing when u press the ress scroll, try to press it when your paladin heal CD is almost done. so that the paladin could cast the heal right after your pt ress to get them to full HP. Careful on the last area in this stage. After u cleared 4/4, there will be another fight with bliss foxy. *Besure to stock up your ress scroll before entering this last area*.
I cleared it without any help from friend with key unit. Just my team =D. timing is crucial.

###### 2nd Last Stage: Corridor of Sacrifice

Here you will encounter those irritating Deranged Imp Spirit (Again =.=) which explode upon death and deal AoE dmg to your team. Their explosion will wipe most of your team, but not the paladin. DBS could help you abit here. coz when she is life stealing and those things explode. she is not affected. If you have Stormbear, it should help to certain extends when he is on his immortality buff. There is something you need to beware of, those bear like mobs, they could stun your Main Char and when you are stunned, you could not scroll. I game-overed a few times because of this. I tried to switch my team around, enhance my D.Brightspark to Ultimate and level up a new formation: Fire Support which is the best Offensive Stats currently in the game. I changed my team to use 2 Priest (with ress), 2 DPS, 1 Healer Paladin. With those changes, i manage to end this =D .

###### Last stage of season 3: Hall of Past Heroes

This stage is super hard for those without Buster / Dark soul. The mobs here hit very very hard and alot of AoE unit and suicidal bomber mobs. You will need someone with skills that protect the party such as Kymeal HP Shield, Falcon/Omega Invulnerable shield or utiliy skill like ress upon dead (Kymeal, Messenger Shabelle). Or tanker that can keep him self alive while taunting all the mobs (D.Deathcrown & Stormbear). I use stormbear here part of the reason is i could make him with my Max SSS Tanker and his skill set that make him unkillable when his 3rd skill is active. This could create some time lag for you to wait for scrolls CD and when mobs atking stormbear, part of the DMG taken will be reflected back. This make them to die from their own ATK. Use scroll only when your bear is down/dead.

On Hall of Past Heroes 9, ready your friend with key-unit. On this stage, you will fight Darksoul Ragnarok at the end. After 4/4 wave, there will be a cutscene where winter bana summon out the Disgael and Manalandy together with Brightspark will stay behind to fight him. You and your team will move forward to fight Ragnarok. When you caught up to him, be ready to summon your friend out. Once his HP drop 1/3, Manalandy and Brightspark will arrive and join in the fight, and the fight become easier.

###### Unlocking Destruction Ragnarok Raid

After the fight at Hall of Past Heroes, you still need to fight Darksoul-Ragnarok one more time without the help of Manalandy and Brightspark. The tactic is the same, just need to bring your Key-Unit Friend to this battle. Summon them at the start of the battle, should not be so hard. Once you beat it, the game credits for season 3 will be up and then you will be sent to the season 3 lobby. You will be rewarded with *300 Rubies* for completing for the first time.

##### What to do from here?

You had finished the Season 3 of Dragon blaze, now what you should do is determine which darksould or dragon buster to make, enhance your ally further, get more ally fodder, gold and rubies through participating on various event weekly. Also go focus on getting the new equipment from Destruction Ragnarok Raid. This raid gonna be hard for those without key, but you could help out your team by bringing in Revival Order Scroll or Resurrect Scroll if you cant afford.
