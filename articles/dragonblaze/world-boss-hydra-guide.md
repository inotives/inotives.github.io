#### World Boss Guide: Hydra

---

Hydra, based on Greek and Roman myth was a many-headed serpent like mobs. In Dragon blaze, it is the same. It consist of 5 heads which like previous world boss golem, able to go into Rage (Frenzy) Mode which is they become red and enlarge. Due to the many head, you will need ally that could hit multiple targets (AoE, Splash, etc). Continuos DMG works well with this world boss as well. Let talk in more details below.

`SIDE-NOTES`: For new player, Try to get pass 1 Million score, you will get *15 Rubies* additional as reward and do it 10x every week, that would be 300k easy GOLD income.


##### 1. PARTY COMPOSITION

When fighting World-Boss, you will always need Buffers and DPS. Healer is not really needed here (not unless late in the fight.). This world boss have 5 heads, therefore you could DMG all 5 of them to gain score. So ally the could deal `multiple hits` had advantage here. Buffers wise should be the same as Golem.

| ALLY & KEY           | ROLE | PERFORMANCE | DETAILS |
| :------------------- | :--- | :---------- | :------ |
| Priest (Magnify Build) | BUFFER | `SSS` | Probably the only MC that can score high in any World-Boss due to her mass pt buff (ATK & ATK.SPD). Some player would build priest tanky, meaning the priest will use those STR or DEF equipment (e.q. on armor you will find those STA,DEF,HP, EVA stats). *NOTE: if you have Epsilon, equip it on priest and set it to 1% summon. This will help you last longer late in the fight.* |
| Paladin (Oath-Judgement Build) | BUFFER | `SS` | Alternative to Mag-Priest. Constant atk buff aura for whole team. but performance slightly lower than priest due to no Atk.SPD buff.  |
| [Ravengale](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/ravengale-the-kind) | BUFFER | `SSS` | Ravengale is one of the few buffer in the game. It buffs whole pt with increase Atk & ATK.SPD. She will need alot of atk.spd and CDR items to make her buff always up (or even stack sometimes). In the current meta, she was push to helper position. |
| [Iota](/game/dragon-blaze/key/iota) in [Margaret](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/Margaret)  | DPS&BUFFER | SSS | Iota is best buffer key in-game for world boss. it has passive dmg increase for whole pt when fighting agaisnt world boss as well as buffs that increase pt atk and atk.spd. Using margaret as keyholder so that we could use iota side by side with [Ravengale](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/ravengale-the-kind). She is not only buffer but also DPS for the team. Top 50 player setup will always put her in dps position. Some effect suggestion on her are CDR+D.o.T |
| [Omega](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dragon-buster-omega) in [D.Falcon](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/drunken-falcon) | BUFFER | SSS | Omega + Falcon is another scoring factor in World Boss. Falcon has passive to increase normal atk by 100% and omega also have passive that increase normal atk by 100%, and you know what, both are applicable if you use falcon with omega key, your pt normal atk will increase by 200%. |
| [Tiehr](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-tiehr) in Lucienne | DPS | `SSS` | Tiehr normal atk able to hit 2 target at the same time, go for hydra. Using her on lucienne amplify her dmg more due to her passive that increase dmg to boss. |
| [Tinulvian](/game/dragon-blaze/deity/tinulvian-the-poison-fang) | DPS | `SSS` | current *META* for Hydra. Don't ever underestimate her poison DMG over Time (D.o.T). She could out perform any other unit (even key-unit) in term of overall DMG dealt to hydra. Mostly due to her poison skill set that is able to deal DoT to all heads and critical. Her survival in the fights is also good. Keeping her alive as long as you can to get highest score possible. |
| [Gaia] (/game/dragon-blaze/key/dragon-buster-gaia) in (Fredyrk / D.Brightspark) | DPS | 'SS' | Gaia is another good unit to use in Hydra due to the normal atk is splash atk. Its Skills are mostly AoE, good for this world boss. |
| [Stigma] (/game/dragon-blaze/key/dragon-buster-stigma) in (Lucienne / Loki / Mikaela) | DPS | 'SS' | Stigma could be used in hydra as well, due to its sheer powerful dmg burst and survivality. But due to its skill set are mostly single target, it is less effective than the rest of meta. |




##### 2. FORMATION

Formation playing substantial role in increasing your dmg out put. Here are some popular formation use in this world boss. For this world boss you need as much fire power as possible. So Offensive Formation is much preferred.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <h6 class="amber-text text-ligthen-3">FIRE SUPPORT </h6>
    <u>POINT ALLOCATION: </u> Max out all 2 DPS position and Mid Normal position then allocate remaining point to rear normal position.
    <br/><br/>

    This Formation have the best dmg output compare to the rest. 3 slots that increase Base DMG and 1 rear spot that increase Atk.SPD, moreover the general effect of the formation is Fixed DMG (purple dmg). These factors make this formation one of the must have formation and 2 normal position that can fit in any class make this formation very flexible as well. One notes though, try to switch gear around and place your mag priest at the rear position.

    <br/><br/>
    <u>TEAM SUGGESTION:</u> <br/>
    ~ MAIN: Mag-Priest, Tinulvian, Tiehr in Lucienne, Iota in Margaret, Omega in Falcon HELPER: Ravengale <br/>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


##### 3. WEAPON EFFECTS & CARDS

Another important factor in WB if you gonna score high. Below are some Weapon effect you need for this world boss:

  </td></tr>

</table>



##### 4. Finalizing

In conclusion, this world boss required multi-hitter allies and D.o.T effect if possible and of course the standard buffers (Raven, Iota, Belle). With those in place, you should be able to score high. Overall this world boss setup is quite similar to the one in Golem with slight variation.
