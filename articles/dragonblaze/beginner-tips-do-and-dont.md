Dragon blaze is a good game with lots of rewards been generously given to new players for them to catch up to the veterans. But you will need something to guide those new players out there to effectively make use on the resources given. Here i shall share out some tips, dos and donts as new player.

<i class="amber-text text-ligthen-3">NOTES: I will keep update this when i think of more or if you have anything to add can left me a message on comments.</i>

Here are things that you need to do:

###### 1. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Get all your starter rubies, rewards and make good use of them.
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Previously i had written an article on [How to start DB effectively](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/effective-beginner-guide), Follow through and you should have a good foundation to carry on. Most of the player make mistake after these. So read the rest of the tips.
</p>

###### 2. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Balancing your focus
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  There are various contents in Dragon-blaze, but overall could be group into *2 category*, `PVP` & `PVE`. PVP are those that you compete with other players team setup such as Arena and Guild-Battle. PVE are those you set your team to win against Mobs/Bosses such as World-Boss, Guild-Adventure, Dungeon, Labyrinth. In term of reward, PVE contents give out more. You could try to get ally that can perform in both contents such as [Draco Brightspark](/game/dragon-blaze), Tinulvian, Blackaria, Falcon, Fulson and more. Check out [Tier list](/game/dragon-blaze/dbg-global-tier-list) for more.
</p>

###### 3. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Give yourself some time to catch up
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  This happen in all the mature player game (mean the game had been around more than a year+), it is not easy to catch up to the current top player. But with the resources given by gamevil, it is quite easy to catch up compare to the other mature game. Probably around *1 or 2 Months* to reach around 5% - 10% if you are diligent in gearing yourself and amassing resources through dungeon hunting. Most of the F2P player is around 1%-5%. Top 50 mostly consist of Player that paid certain amount of Cash to stay competitive or veteran player that play since Day-1 of Dragon blaze.
</p>

###### 4. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Ultimate your DPS first
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Well, the reason is DPS are what u need to score high in every event. Healer and Tanker are good for surviving, but not really helping for your scoring in PVE nor PVP. Buffer mostly used in World-Boss and Guild-Adventure but without DPS they are useless. Get at least 2 DPS in your team, i suggest to get *Tinulvian* on your Hero Tix and *Draco Brightspark* on your Draco Tix.
</p>

###### 5. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Ultimate Deity 1-by-1 rather than Full team +0 Deities
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Just like above point, you just need around 2 DPS in order to start scoring in every contents of the game. Therefore Ultimate those 2 DPS must be put as priority. I could easily clear off those Full team Non-Max Deity with just 1 or 2 Ultimate DPS.
</p>

###### 6. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Aim to create 1 Key and Ultimate it.
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  The tips of getting DPS first is apply on Key as well. Healer, Tanker and Buffer type of key are support type which you need some DPS in order for them to work. So u need to choose a DPS key that can carry your team and try to ULT it. Currently the best DPS key in game should be [Tiehr](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-tiehr). Some other key that is worth making are [Dragon Buster Omega](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dragon-buster-omega), due to its usage in every contents of the game as well as his buffs & invulnerability shield. Here are some future Key-Unit that worth consideration: [Shasha](/game/dragon-blaze/key/dark-soul-shasha) & [Askr](/game/dragon_blaze/key/dark-soul-askr). Another reason for focusing on 1 key is to make use of them in Guild Battle. Guild are more willing to take you in if you have at least 1 Ult key to help in their Buster League GB. 
</p>

###### 7. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Participate once in all contents (arena/wb/lab/CoA/GA)
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Even you cant score, doesn't mean that you cant participate. There are some participation reward given each week when you participate once in the events. The reward consist of Rubies, Coins and some ally tickets. This [Calculator](/game/dragon-blaze/reward-calculator) could help you estimate your rubies income per week base on your current rank in each content.
</p>

###### 8. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Use your rubies on buying shoes
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Golden rule, Shoes = everything in this game. By using your rubies to buy shoes, you could gain Gold, Ally Fodders, Item Fodder and Essences. It is more profiting to spend your rubies on shoes rather than other things like summoning allies (unless there is 1+1 summoning reward event) or costumes. The only downside is more time consuming to run dungeon but thanks to auto dungeoning feature in the game, just buy huge number of shoes and let it auto away.
</p>

###### 9. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Join a guild
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Join a guild will given you access to Guild-Battle and Guild-Adventure. The weekly reward from this 2 event was alot for some Top Guild (especially Guild Battle). Even the participation reward from Guild Battle itself is worthwhile (every week participate in Heroes League GB for *50 Rubies* and Buster GB for another *50 Rubies*). Other than Guild battle, there are Guild adventure that give out alot of rubies as well.
  But by joining a guild, you will need to give some contribution to the weekly GB. Other than reward, you could also get tips and tricks from veteran in your guild.
</p>

###### 10. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Arena on First day of weekly-reset and DONT auto-battle
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Personally i think Arena is the only place where new player could score if you spam your tix on the first day of the reset. Usually on the first day, there will be more new player in the pool, so you are more likely to encounter team of your level. Keep going in and out of arena to refresh the list.
</p>

###### 11. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Get some Paid Formation later
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  When you are more or less settling down, you could try think of getting a few Formation. The first 2 formation could get u far enough when you are just started, but later on you will need some paid (with rubies) formation in order to compete. The current meta formation would be Fire Support. It is an offensive base formation that is used in almost all top-tier players in all contents. Some notes - *Dont spent rubies leveling them, just spent the rubies on shoes and level them manually in dungeon*
</p>

###### 12. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Unlock your Accessory, Item, inventory and Storage slots on your Character
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Unlock all the accessory and items slot on your focus character (current fav char: Priest and Paladin) early on. This could help you in your journey in season 3 where you need higher stats (Accessories - rings) and Ressurect Scroll (on item slots). Unlock your inventory slot for your main farming character for easier life later on. Try to unlock all 5 pages of your storage slots as well. These could help you store all the items from raids, dungeons, events later on in game.
</p>

###### 13. <strong class="lime-text text-lighten-1">DO</strong>: Save all your Gems and Combine them
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  All the gems you got from Season 2 maps onward should be kept and combine them. Gems is very helpful in increasing your character and allies stats and you will need alot of them. Best place to farm those gems currently is on Destruction Dungeons.
</p>



<br />
Here are things you need to avoid doing:

###### 1. <strong class="red-text text-lighten-4">DON'T</strong>: Forget to do your daily & weekly quest
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Every day, there will be some quests available for some rubies upon completion. Do not ignore them. Every rubies count. Other than daily, there are weekly quest that is available to complete.
</p>

###### 2. <strong class="red-text text-lighten-4">DON'T</strong>: Spend your rubies on Costume
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Spending your rubies on costume at at the start of the game is a No-No. Completely wasted. Those costume doesnt really increase stats alot. It is better to spend rubies else where such as buying shoes and run dungeon, or get pet dragon (they are good for auto-ing every things.)
</p>

###### 3. <strong class="red-text text-lighten-4">DON'T</strong>: Summon Premium Allies unless it is 1+1 Summon reward week
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Yes, you do not hear me wrong, don't summon allies using rubies unless it is event week. This event is call 1+1 summon reward. How this event work? When u do bulk premium summon (300 rubies), upon getting 3 A, you will be rewarded a S ally tix, 3 S Rewarded a SS ally tix, 3 SS rewarded a SSS ally tix. During event period, your reward will be doubled, meaning instead of 1 SSS you get 2 SSS upon completing. You can do as many times as you wan during event period (usually 1 week).
</p>

###### 4. <strong class="red-text text-lighten-4">DON'T</strong>: Buy essences from shop unless really needed and GOLD...
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Essences could be get easily by grinding in red stage at dungeon. It is better to use your rubies on shoes and run them at dungeon for ess, allies, items and gold. On average, per 100 shoes you could get at least 1-4 essences (depend on RNG) as well as Gold.
</p>

###### 5. <strong class="red-text text-lighten-4">DON'T</strong>: Use SS Allies as Fodder to enhance SSS/Deity Units
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 18px;">
  Please dont use do that, it is very waste of your SS ally. They should be max and fuse to get SSS instead. Please refer to following [enhancement guide](http://dbaddiction.wikia.com/wiki/Enhancing) for how to correctly enhance.
