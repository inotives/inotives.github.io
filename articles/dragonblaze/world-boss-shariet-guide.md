#### World Boss Guide: Shariet (not-complete-yet)

---

Shariet is the 3rd boss introduced in Dragon Blaze. This boss works quite different than the previous 2. There will be some helper allies appears in the fight. These allies will be dealing lots of DMG to the boss. Your role here is to make sure they are alive and kicking the boss ass. Main tactic on this world boss is `Def.Down & Atk.Spd Down the boss, Buffs your helper allies & keep them alive as long as possible`. So in order to excel in this boss, your ally will be mostly healer, debuffer or tanker.


##### 1. META CHAR & ALLIES

<table>
<tr><td>
NAME: <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/char/priest">Magnify Priest</a> <br/>
ROLE: BUFFER <br/>
PERFORMANCE: SSS <br/>
KEY: Shiva / Epsilon (both set at 1%)<br/>
DETAILS: <br/>
Probably the only MC that can score high in any World-Boss due to her mass pt buff (ATK & ATK.SPD). Some player would build priest tanky, meaning the priest will use those STR or DEF equipment (e.q. on armor you will find those STA,DEF,HP, EVA stats). The buff itself will effect those varman helper (rollo, her moms and dad). *NOTE: if you have Epsilon/Shiva, equip it on priest and set it to 1% summon. This will help you last longer late in the fight.* For now, epsilon seem stronger due to the fact that it can ress those NPC but Shiva cant.

<tr><td>
NAME: <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/deity/fryderyk-the-tenor">Fryderyk</a> <br/>
ROLE: DE-BUFFER <br/>
PERFORMANCE: SSS <br/>
KEY: Gaia (set at 1%)<br/>
DETAILS: <br/>
Probably one of the most effective deity for this world boss. His auto-atk caused ATK.SPD down which is crucial in slowing down Shari Fire breadth which would clear party buffs and cast fire DoT dmg on pt. If you have gaia, set it to 1% and equip on him.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
NAME: <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/deity/ravengale-the-kind">Ravengale</a> <br/>
ROLE: BUFFER <br/>
PERFORMANCE: SSS <br/>
DETAILS: <br/>
KEY: NOT-USING <br/>
Her main task is to buff parties and NPCs. Her buff will make the NPCs to deal more DMG hence increase scoring. Dont use her with iota, she is better off with no-key.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
NAME: <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/deity/draco-deathcrown">Draco Deathcrown</a> <br/>
ROLE: TANK & DEBUFFER <br/>
PERFORMANCE: SS <br/>
KEY: Pluto (set at 1%) <br/>
DETAILS: <br/>
He is a good ally to use on this boss. His emblem of demise is useful here to further decrease Shari def. His taunt skill also help to prevent shari from atking priest and other healer/buffer. If you have pluto, use it on him and set it to 1%. Pluto auto-atk which decrease def is good to weaken shari def as well.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
NAME: <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/deity/kymael-the-just">Kymael</a> <br/>
ROLE: TANK & Buffer<br/>
PERFORMANCE: SSS <br/>
KEY: Omega (Set at 100%) <br/>
DETAILS: <br/>
Use her with omega and set it at 100%. Omega will buff atk of whole pt and increase normal atk dmg. With kymael, you could ress back whole pt when she died. Practically get rid of DoT dmg from fire breadth.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
NAME: <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/deity/drunken-falcon">Drunken Falcon</a> <br/>
ROLE: TANK & Buffer<br/>
PERFORMANCE: SS <br/>
KEY: Omega (Set at 100%) <br/>
DETAILS: <br/>
Use either him or kymael on Omega. His normal atk buff is good for whole pt. But some rumour said that his normal atk buff doesnot effect the NPC. I used both him and kymael to test, i get more score with kymael.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
NAME:  <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/deity/calgar-the-master-of-spirits">Calgar</a> <br/>
ROLE: Healer & Debuffer<br/>
PERFORMANCE: SS <br/>
KEY: Epsilon (Set at 1%) <br/>
DETAILS: <br/>
Many had said calgar is not that good for shari, but that is not true. Although his heal does not do much, but his Grand Punishement (decr atk.spd by 49%) is good in this boss. But major reason i grade him as SS in this is because of his Spirit Wolf Leader skills that summon 2 wolves. These wolves will carry what ever weapon effect used by calgar. example if i had equip Def.Down & Atk.Spd Down, both of these wolves will also inflict same def.down & atk.spd down on shari. This mean that we have 2 additional debuffer when those wolves are out and their duration is quite long (20 sec, skill CD 23.7s)

<tr><td>
NAME:  <a href="/game/dragon-blaze/deity/dragon-slayer-lucienne">Lucienne</a> <br/>
ROLE: Debuffer<br/>
PERFORMANCE: SS <br/>
KEY: Stigma (Set at 100%) <br/>
DETAILS: <br/>
mostly will ask, why lucienne is used here? well she is used mainly because of stigma and her def down debuff skill. When on stigma, stigma will cast a good def down on shari (def -50% for 10 sec, skill cd 16.1s)

##### 2. FORMATION

For shariet, Formation does not really make much impact. Just use whatever the formation that fit your pt setup nicely. Check the party setup section below for some suggestion.


##### 3. PARTY SETUP

<table>
  <tr><td>
  <h6>SUGGESTION-1</h6>
  FORMATION: Fire Support/<br/>
  CHAR: Priest - Magnify Build <br/>
  ALLIES & KEY: <br/>
  Fryderyk, Ravengale, Margaret+Iota, Kymael+Omega <br/>
  HELPER: Belle Snow <br/>
  REASON: <br/>
  This setup is one of the most common setup. Other than fryderyk, the rest of the party are mainly use to buff the NPC and debuff the def of Shari by using weapon effect (Def Down). Fryderyk will slow down the boss so that it wont shoot fire breadth so often. Summon Belle Snow when King Varman is out. If you get it correct, this setup would net you at least in Top 5%.
  </td></tr>

  <h6>SUGGESTION-2</h6>
  FORMATION: Fire Support/<br/>
  CHAR: Priest - Magnify Build <br/>
  ALLIES & KEY: <br/>
  Fryderyk, Lucienne(Stigma), Margaret+Iota, Kymael+Omega <br/>
  HELPER: Belle Snow <br/>
  REASON: <br/>
  Make use of stigma def.down debuff to lower down def of shari. Move ravengale to helper position.

##### 3. WEAPON EFFECTS

On Shari, weapon effects is one of the most important factor to score. There are quite a lot of variation on what effect to use on each meta allies, but overall idea is to stack as much Def.Down and Atk.Spd Down on Shari. Here are what my preferences:

- Mag Priest: CDR + CDR
- Fryderyk: Def.Down + Atk.SPD Down
- Ravengale: CDR + Def.Down
- Iota (Margaret / Yvante): CDR + Def.Down
- Omega (Kymael / Falcon): CDR + Def.Down
- Stigma (Any Rogue Deity): CDR + Def.Down
- Pluto (DDC): AtkSpd.Down + Def.Down
- Calgar: AtkSpd.Down + Def Down / Def.Down & CDR
