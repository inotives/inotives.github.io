##### Character Building

###### 1. Magnify Build

Skill Distribution:

- ACTIVE: [ 0 | 11 | 0 ]
- PASSIVE: [ 12 | 12 | 12 | 0 ]
- SKILL POINT USED: 91/96

This build is mainly used in world bosses. It focus on the Magnify (2nd Active) which buff whole pt for their Atk and Atk.Spd. This is important in world boss where dmg output determine your final scoring. This build need to equip with weapons that have CDR (Cool Down Reduction) effect weapons for maximum potential, because with CDR, your magnify would recover the CD faster hence keeping constant buff (sometime will even stacked - Max 2) to whole party. This build healing is mainly depend on healer auto-atk, hence higher atk.spd will be preferred. So earring would be the best choice of accessory for this build. With more ATK.SPD, more hp could be heal and more CDR will be cast and constant buff could be achieved. This skill build is optimized for KeyHolder because all 3 Passive are carry over when character transformed.

###### 2. Guidance Build

Skill Distribution (Variation-1):

- ACTIVE: [ 10 | 0 | 11 ]
- PASSIVE: [ 5 | 10 | 12 | 8 ]
- SKILL POINT USED: 95/96

Skill Distribution (Variation-2):

- ACTIVE: [ 0 | 0 | 11 ]
- PASSIVE: [ 12 | 12 | 12 | 0 ]
- SKILL POINT USED: 91/96

There are 2 variation of this build: *Partial Healer* and *Full Guidance* build. Both variation would have ULTIMATE the Guidance skill for AoE clear pt debuff. Main difference is with the healing skill. On variation-1, we aim to be sub healer by adding Charming Light, 1st passive and 4th passive. This will make charming light to have a splash heal to the surrounding allies (a weaker version of heal-all). This group heal help in maintaining pt HP. accessories choice could be EVA necklace or Atk.Spd Earrings, both are ok.

On variation-2, We totally omitted the Charming Light and max both all 1st, 2nd and 3rd passive. By omitting charming light, there will be no animation delay (when casting charming light there will be some delay). Similar to Magnify build, all the healing on this build will depend on the Auto-Atk Heal, therefore Atk.Spd accessories is preferred. It will also be good if you use 2xCDR or CDR+ATK.SPD Incr weapon effect here. This skill build is optimized for KeyHolder because all 3 Passive are carry over when character transformed.

###### 3. Full Healer Build

Skill Distribution

- ACTIVE: [ 11 | 0 | 1 ]
- PASSIVE: [ 12 | 8 | 9 | 12 ]
- SKILL POINT USED: 94/96

Not many use this build anymore mainly due to Ally healer had out performed the character healer by alot and they could revive whereas char cant. Ultimate the first active for its healing power, max level 1st passive and 2nd passive to increase the healing amount and splash amount.


##### Equipments, Weapon Stats, Gems and Accessories

*For Staff: Critical Atk, Critical DMG, Weapon Max Atk, Weapon ATK*. Priest do no require any sort of DefPen and Accuracy. So pure Double ATK, Double Critical stats is preferred. *For Orb: Sta, Critical Atk, Critical DMG, Weapon ATK / Weapon Max Atk / INT*. Same as Staff, Defpen and Acc do not required. But diff on orb is that it carry STA stats. It is good to have for priest to get additional HP through STA. As for Effect, of course go for CDR (Cooldown Reduction) for both orb and staff. You will need them to procs more magnify buffs.

For armor, there are some variation. Some would want to get some *INT for higher healing*, some would go *STA & DEF for higher HP and Defend*. My own preference is Tanky build so i would go for *Armor with STA, DEF, EVA, HP (on Body and Shoes)* as Priority and *STA, DEF, HP, Decrease C.DMG for Gloves and Helmet*. The reason i omitted INT is because i mainly use priest in WB where i need to survive long enough to keep on buffing the team.

For Gems, depend on you wan to balance between survival and heal, you could gems *6 STA, 6 INT*. I preferred to put survival a priority hence i use *All STA gems*.

For accessories, *earrings* is the most popular choice due to its increment in ATK.SPD. If you are magnify build, earrings is without doubt your best choice. For healer and guidance build, some necklace could be put in to increase your EVA, HP and DEF.

##### Priest Usage in various contents

###### ARENA - BUSTER
In current meta, if you are using priest as your main arena character, first thing first is to set your key to summon at 1%, esspecially if you are using shiva. With this, your shiva will survive the initial burst when the battle start and summon out to ress some key. If you are using epsilon, i would say set it at 100%, coz epsilon have AoE heal / Atk. You build must be keyholder build (max first 3 passive).

###### ARENA - HERO
Guidance priest play major role here, cure bad status and auto-heal pt (although not that much). Her passive also give good amount of immunity to party to prevent them from those bad status. With this your party will be free to spam whatever skills the want as long as priest is not stun/hex/dead.

###### WORLD BOSSES (GOLEM, HYDRA, SHARIET) & Guild Adventure
Priest play the role of buffer here. So magnify build is the best to use. in fact no other build can be use here. One thing to take note is your weapons both need to have Cooldown Reduction effect. The same principle applies to Guild Adventure. Both these event main purpose are to get the highest possible score through dealing DMG to the target. So buffer build dominates here.

###### GUILD BATTLE - BUSTER
Not really that helpful to have a healer key in guild battle. Everything happen so fast, i don think healer are needed.

###### GUILD BATTLE - HERO
Guidance Priest is quite useful in this mode. Help to clear debuff for teams. Hero mode tends to be longer per battle as compare to Buster GB. Therefore there are still chancces for priest to do healing and clear debuff.
