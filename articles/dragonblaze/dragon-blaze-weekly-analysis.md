#### Dragon Blaze Weekly Analysis

---

##### What is this?

Well ... these are the collection of my thoughts, insights as well as meta shift (line-up) of Dragon blaze. After 1 year+ of playing dragon blaze (since Chapter 1), i really do feel that the game offer alot of contents for player to enjoy and compete on. But some issues also came with more contents which are the complexity. And most of the guides out there are unable to keep up to date with the changes happening in Dragon Blaze. 1 Game patch will sometimes changes the meta on some contents to a very big extends. So i thought it is good to have such a place where we could discuss and record the latest tactics, meta line-up and thoughts of the game.
