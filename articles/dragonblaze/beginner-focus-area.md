#### Focus Area For Beginner

---

As new player in dragon blaze, you will tend to be lost and confuse because there are so much things to learn. There are Arena (Buster & Hero League), Labryrinth, World bosses, etc. This article shall give you some insight and tips in each of the contents in the game as new player.


Some side notes, as new player, you should know that you wont be scoring that high in each content (i would say 50% is consider quite well for start) and slowly move up the rank. Decide on which contents you wanna excel in an then focus on building your allies and keys around that.

##### 1. Guild Battle (PVP)

*You must join a Guild !* or create yourself a guild. This will grant you access to Guild Battle which reset Weekly. If you found a guild that is active in GB, you could get quite a number of rubies from this. Even the guild is not very active, you could still get `100 rubies` per week for just participate once. Try to get 1 Key (Buster/Darksoul) to Max. With this, you should be able to complete in GB.

Reward: `at least 100 Rubies + X Rubies depend on your rank`

##### 2. Arena (PVP)

As new player, arena could be quite difficult. There are 2 modes, Hero and Buster league. Both are quite a challenge for new player. Arenas are one of the event
Here are some tips that could get you some advantages:

- Start doing your arena *right after every week reset*. There will be a lot of new player which your could fight.
- Try to choose the opponent that you could win, by going in and out of the arena. This will reset the list.
- Participate at least once for both leagues. This will give you grant you `100 Rubies` in total.

I test try with my newbie account (account used to make this [guide](/game/dragon-blaze/articles/effective-beginner-guide)), i could score around 50% in both Hero & Buster league. But this will require you to refresh very often. The arena is not really that hard, it just whether how many tix you are willing to spent thats all.

Reward: `100 Rubies + X rubies & X Coins depend on your rank`

##### 3. World Boss (Hydra, Golem, Shari) - (PVE)

World bosses probably the hardest for new player to score. They require specific allies in order to score well (Ravengale, Falcon, Lucienne, Tinulvian, etc...).
and Requirement for each world boss is quite different (Hydra, Golem is about the same, by Shariet is quite different). It will be alot of hardwork and catch-up if you decide to excel here. Check-out [Here](/game/dragon-blaze/top-allies-keys) for the allies use in each world-boss.

Reward: `20 Rubies each boss as participation + X rubies depend on your rank`


##### 4. Labyrinth (PVE)

This is one of the area where new player should focus on. The rubies reward is not alot but it give a lot of ally tickets. As new player just aim to go pass lvl 100 will do. This will give you 3 x SS Ally and couple of B to S ally summon tix. With those ally tickets you get here and some graining in Dungeon, you can almost made at least 2-3 SSS per week. Check-out [Here](/game/dragon-blaze/top-allies-keys) for some suggestion on the allies and formation used.

Reward: `Coins, Allies, Rubies, Gold.` Try to pass level 100.


##### 5. Fortress (PVP)

Fortress is another content where new player wont be able to score much. Because it required 14 Allies to setup a full defences. The reward is given out daily, the amount is quite small but if add-up the amount for whole week, is quite a lot. Just do your best on this and setup your defense team well.

Reward: `Coins & Rubies. Send out daily.`
