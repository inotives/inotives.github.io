Base on some experiment run by various redditor that played on KR, she is better off with INT base set (Gems, Equipment and Card) due to her ability to stuns and deal additional DMG to stun target. Build her with high Accuracy stats so that she wont miss (stuns as well). She have huge STA(HP) and active-2 make her survivality high without needing to pump more def, if you prefer to build her offensive, use INT base gear on her. Of course you could also build her high base ATK and DEF with STR base items and cards, this will make her tankier but not as tank as full fledge tanker (she is more DPS than Tank/Support). In my opinion, STR base item is good if you intend to use her as KeyHolder for Askr/Omega.
