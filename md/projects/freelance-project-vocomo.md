<div id="top"></div>

This project was mainly created as demo project for Energy Week Conference 2012 at NTU. VoCoMO was a simulation prototype that visualized the energy usage in an office. It was to illustrate the idea of a smart office where user could remote control all the appliances in the office from the web. A small portable and mobile friendly controller was also developed along with the prototype.

    <h5>Mobile Controller</h5>
    <p>
    Mobile controller for vocomo was designed using JQtouch UI framework that is responsive for Mobile webapps. As for the backend, in order to ensure fast data exchange and simulatneous access to the system, we had use NodeJS as the backend communication server between controller and main Systsem. Many user are able to user the controller to control the system at the same. By making the controller as an webapps, user can just access the web address to directly used the services without any installation at all.
